This document describes open todo points.

Suggestion:
- It makes sense to have one place where we host the documentation
- We can currently not use the same infrastructure for both teams, but we could
  try to merge it.
- Who would be responsible for the documentation framework?
	US:
	DE: Jonas Remmert
- If there is a will from both sides to migrate to one infrastructure, we
  should go for it.

Major:
######
- Can the documentation differ in their style?
	- US:
		- Multiple Page Layout without numbering
		- No, or very less substitutions
	- DE:
		- One Page Layout with numbering
		- Use of substitutions
	- Solutions:
		- Every team can decide for themselves how they want to
		  structure the documentation?
		- No common documentation parts inbetween different platforms (teams)
		- Basic infrastructure is the same for both teams:
			- Sphinx
			- HTML/PDF generation
			- Github Actions
		- Alternative is to find compromises and document them.
			- Can we identify common parts?
			- More work, requires flexibility from German/US teams
			- That can help new teams as they have a guideline.
			- Helps customers to understnad the documentation for different platforms.
- How BSP Versions are handled
	- Only one version visible as of now
	[] How does US do the versioning?
	[] Do you want to adapt the DE model of having seperate files?
- Common Files for BSPs:
	- DE uses common files, at least for i.MX8 BSPs
	- Solutions: 
		- Can decide to use or not to use those common files
		- Maybe common files should be placed in a different location,
		  to make clear they are only suitable for German BSP/Doc
		  Structure.
- Release Files:
	- US handles them in documentation
	- DE handles them seperately in release file
	- Solutions:
		[] US: Can we point to release file?
		[] DE: Add a link to release files
- Where to host?
	- DE: Github Pages
	- US: Selfhosted

Minor:
######
- Style:
	- No character-limit per line in US
	[] Is it ok to limit the max number of characters per line to 80?
- Maintainers:
	- If we merge things, we would need one maintainer for US, one for DE team
- Images:
	- US: in own imagedir
	- DE: imagedir per module variant
	[] Image dir per module variant makes the filenames shorter, as they
	have their own namespace - can we change it?
- For what did you define quickstart labels e.g. _Quickstart-62 in
  phycore-am62x/quickstart/index.rst
- Inside am57 BSP there is the phyCORE-AM64x mentioned most of the time. Is
  this a bug?
