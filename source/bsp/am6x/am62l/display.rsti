.. supported-display-interfaces-marker-start

The |sbc| supports up to 3 different display outputs. The following table shows
the required extensions and devicetree overlays for the different interfaces.
For the alpha release, we have included overlay for ``powertip,ac209``
LVDS display.
The name can be found on the back of the display.

.. note::
   Currently only LVDS1 (onboard LVDS) is supported

The default interface is LVDS1 (onboard LVDS).

.. note::

   The current display driver limits the pixel clock for a display connected to
   LVDS to 74.25Mhz (or a divider of it).  If this does not fit your display
   requirements, please contact Support for further help.
