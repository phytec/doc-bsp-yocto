*  Use:

   .. code-block:: console

      target:~$ ip link

   to see the state of the interfaces. The two CAN interfaces should show up as
   can0 and can1.

*  To get information on can0, such as bit rate and error counters, type:

   .. code-block:: console

      target:~$ ip -d -s link show can0

   The information for can0 will look like:

   .. code-block::

      2: can0: <NOARP,UP,LOWER_UP,ECHO> mtu 16 qdisc pfifo_fast state UNKNOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 10
          link/can  promiscuity 0 minmtu 0 maxmtu 0

The output contains a standard set of parameters also shown for Ethernet
interfaces, so not all of these are necessarily relevant for CAN (for example
the MAC address). The following output parameters contain useful information:

========== =============================
can0       Interface Name
========== =============================
NOARP	     CAN cannot use ARP protocol
MTU	     Maximum Transfer Unit
RX packets Number of Received Packets
TX packets Number of Transmitted Packets
RX bytes   Number of Received Bytes
TX bytes   Number of Transmitted Bytes
errors...  Bus Error Statistics
========== =============================


The CAN configuration is done in the systemd configuration
file ``/lib/systemd/network/can0.network``. For a persistent change of (as an
example, the default bitrates), change the configuration in the BSP
under ``./meta-ampliphy/recipes-core/systemd/systemd-conf/can0.network`` in
the root filesystem and rebuild the root filesystem.

.. code-block::

   [Match]
   Name=can0

   [Can]
   BitRate=500000

The bitrate can also be changed manually, for example, to make use of the
flexible bitrate:

.. code-block:: console

   target:~$ ip link set can0 down
   target:~$ ip link set can0 txqueuelen 10 up type can bitrate 500000 sample-point 0.75 dbitrate 4000000 dsample-point 0.8 fd on

You can send messages with cansend or receive messages with candump:

.. code-block:: console

   target:~$ cansend can0 123#45.67
   target:~$ candump can0

To generate random CAN traffic for testing purposes, use cangen:

.. code-block:: console

   target:~$ cangen

``cansend --help`` and ``candump --help`` provide help messages for further information
on options and usage.

.. warning::

   The mcp2518fd SPI to CANfd supports only baudrates starting from 125kB/s.
   Slower rates can be selected but may not work correctly.
