PXP
---

The |soc| SoC contains an PiXel Pipeline (PXP). The PXP combines the following
into a single processing engine:

* Scaling
* Color Space Conversion (CSC)
* Secondary Color Space Conversion (CSC2)
* Rotation

and thus minimizes the memory footprint required for the display pipeline.
How to use the PXP with Gstreamer and Wayland check the `How to Use PXP in
GStreamer and Wayland` (AN13829) Application note from NXP.
