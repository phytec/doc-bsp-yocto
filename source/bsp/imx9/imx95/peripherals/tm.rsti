Thermal Management
------------------

U-Boot
......

There is no Thermal Management support in the first ALPHA release for the
i.MX95 in U-Boot.

Kernel
......

The Linux kernel has integrated thermal management that is capable of monitoring
SoC temperatures, reducing the CPU frequency, driving fans, advising other
drivers to reduce the power consumption of devices, and – worst-case – shutting
down the system gracefully
(https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/thermal/sysfs-api.txt).

This section describes how the thermal management kernel API is used for the
|soc| SoC platform.

There are nine temperature sensors on the SoM that are readable from Linux.
The |socfamily| has two internal temperature sensors for the SoC.
Three internal sensors for the PMICs and four I²C temperature sensors located
close to DRAM, eMMC, ethernet PHY and PMIC.

*  The current temperatures of the system can be read in milli celsius over

   .. code-block:: console

      target:~$ cat /sys/class/hwmon/hwmon*/temp*_input

*  You will get, for example:

   .. code-block::

      48590
      48510
      105000
      105000
      105000
      43562
      43812
      43062
      44875

.. note::

   The PMIC temperature sensors return only the last triggered threshold values and not the
   actual temperature values. The thresholds are 110°C, 125°C, 140°C and 155°C.
   All temperatures lower than 110°C are shown as 105°C as seen in the example.


There are two trip points registered in the device tree. These may
differ depending on the CPU variant. A distinction is made between Commercial,
Industrial and Extended Industrial. For the ALPHA1 i.MX95 release there is only the
Automotive/Extended Industrial temperature range available.

=================== ===================
trip point          Extended Industrial
=================== ===================
passive (warning)   105°C
critical (shutdown) 125°C
=================== ===================

(see kernel sysfs folder ``/sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone0/``)

The kernel thermal management uses these trip points to trigger events and
change the cooling behavior. The following thermal policies (also named thermal
governors) are available in the kernel: Step Wise and Power Allocator. The
default policy used in the BSP is step_wise.

.. tip::

   If the value of the SoC temperature in the sysfs file temp reaches
   *trip_point_1* (critical), the board immediately shuts down to avoid any heat damage.
