*  Show detailed information about the gpiochips. Like their names, consumers,
   direction, active state, and additional flags:

   .. code-block:: console

      target:~$ gpioinfo -c gpiochip0

*  Read the value of a GPIO (e.g GPIO 20 from chip0):

   .. code-block:: console

      target:~$ gpioget -c gpiochip0 20

*  Set the value of GPIO 20 on chip0 to 0 and exit tool:

   .. code-block:: console

      target:~$ gpioset -z -c gpiochip0 20=0

*  Help text of gpioset shows possible options:

   .. code-block:: console

      target:~$ gpioset --help
      Usage: gpioset [OPTIONS] <line=value>...

      Set values of GPIO lines.

      Lines are specified by name, or optionally by offset if the chip option
      is provided.
      Values may be '1' or '0', or equivalently 'active'/'inactive' or 'on'/'off'.

      The line output state is maintained until the process exits, but after that
      is not guaranteed.

      Options:
            --banner		display a banner on successful startup
        -b, --bias <bias>	specify the line bias
			Possible values: 'pull-down', 'pull-up', 'disabled'.
			(default is to leave bias unchanged)
            --by-name		treat lines as names even if they would parse as an offset
        -c, --chip <chip>	restrict scope to a particular chip
        -C, --consumer <name>	consumer name applied to requested lines (default is 'gpioset')
        -d, --drive <drive>	specify the line drive mode
			Possible values: 'push-pull', 'open-drain', 'open-source'.
			(default is 'push-pull')
        -h, --help		display this help and exit
        -l, --active-low	treat the line as active low
        -p, --hold-period <period>
			the minimum time period to hold lines at the requested values
        -s, --strict		abort if requested line names are not unique
        -t, --toggle <period>[,period]...
			toggle the line(s) after the specified period(s)
			If the last period is non-zero then the sequence repeats.
            --unquoted	don't quote line names
        -v, --version		output version information and exit
        -z, --daemonize	set values then detach from the controlling terminal

      Chips:
          A GPIO chip may be identified by number, name, or path.
          e.g. '0', 'gpiochip0', and '/dev/gpiochip0' all refer to the same chip.

      Periods:
          Periods are taken as milliseconds unless units are specified. e.g. 10us.
          Supported units are 's', 'ms', and 'us'.

      *Note*
          The state of a GPIO line controlled over the character device reverts to default
          when the last process referencing the file descriptor representing the device file exits.
          This means that it's wrong to run gpioset, have it exit and expect the line to continue
          being driven high or low. It may happen if given pin is floating but it must be interpreted
          as undefined behavior.

.. warning::

   Some of the user IOs are used for special functions. Before using a user IO,
   refer to the schematic or the hardware manual of your board to ensure that it
   is not already in use.

.. gpios-via-sysfs-marker

GPIOs via sysfs
...............

.. warning::

   Accessing gpios via sysfs is deprecated and we encourage to use libgpiod
   instead.

Support to access GPIOs via sysfs is not enabled by default any more.
It is only possible with manually enabling ``CONFIG_GPIO_SYSFS`` in the kernel
configuration. To make ``CONFIG_GPIO_SYSFS`` visible in menuconfig the option
``CONFIG_EXPERT`` has to be enabled first.

You can also add this option for example to the defconfig you use in
``arch/arm64/configs/`` in the linux kernel sources. For our TI based releases,
this could be for example |kernel-defconfig|::

   ..
   CONFIG_EXPERT=y
   CONFIG_GPIO_SYSFS=y
   ..

Otherwise you can create a new config fragment. This is described in our
|yocto-ref-manual-kernel-and-bootloader-conf|.
