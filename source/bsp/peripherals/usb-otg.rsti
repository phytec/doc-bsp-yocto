USB OTG
-------

Most PHYTEC boards provide a USB OTG interface. USB OTG ports automatically act
as a USB device or USB host. The mode depends on the USB hardware attached to
the USB OTG port. If, for example, a USB mass storage device is attached to the
USB OTG port, the device will show up as ``/dev/sda``.
