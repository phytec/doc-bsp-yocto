The unified BSP includes support for mass storage devices and keyboards. Other
USB-related device drivers must be enabled in the kernel configuration on
demand. Due to udev, all mass storage devices connected get unique IDs and can
be found in ``/dev/disk/by-id``. These IDs can be used in ``/etc/fstab`` to mount the
different USB memory devices in different ways.
