Getting Started
===============

The |kit| is shipped with a pre-flashed SD card. It contains the
|yocto-imagename| and can be used directly as a boot source. The eMMC is
programmed with only a U-Boot by default. You can get all sources from the
`PHYTEC download server <dl-server_>`_. This chapter explains how to flash a BSP
image to SD card and how to start the board.

There are several ways to flash an image to SD card or even eMMC. Most notably
using simple, sequential writing with the Linux command line tool ``dd``. An
alternative way is to use PHYTEC's system initialization program called
`partup <https://github.com/phytec/partup>`_, which makes it especially easy to
format more complex systems. You can get `prebuilt Linux binaries of partup
<https://github.com/phytec/partup/releases>`__ from its release page. Also read
`partup's README <https://github.com/phytec/partup#readme>`__ for installation
instructions.

Get the Image
-------------

The image contains all necessary files and makes sure partitions and any raw
data are correctly written. Both the partup package and the WIC image, which can
be flashed using ``dd``, can be downloaded from the `PHYTEC download server
<dl-server_>`_.

Get either the partup package or the WIC image from the download server:

.. code-block:: console
   :substitutions:

   host:~$ wget |link-partup-package|
   host:~$ wget |link-image|

.. note::
   For eMMC, more complex partitioning schemes or even just large images, we
   recommend using the partup package, as it is faster in writing than ``dd``
   and allows for a more flexible configuration of the target flash device.

Write the Image to SD Card
--------------------------

.. warning::
   To create your bootable SD card, you must have root privileges on your Linux
   host PC. Be very careful when specifying the destination device! All files
   on the selected device will be erased immediately without any further query!

   Selecting the wrong device may result in **data loss** and e.g. could erase
   your currently running system on your host PC!

Finding the Correct Device
..........................

To create your bootable SD card, you must first find the correct device name
of your SD card and possible partitions. If any partitions of the SD cards are
mounted, unmount those before you start copying the image to the SD card.

#. In order to get the correct device name, remove your SD card and
   execute:

   .. code-block:: console

      host:~$ lsblk

#. Now insert your SD card and execute the command again:

   .. code-block:: console

      host:~$ lsblk

#. Compare the two outputs to find the new device names listed in the second
   output. These are the device names of the SD card (device and partitions if
   the SD card was formatted).
#. In order to verify the device names being found, execute the command
   ``sudo dmesg``. Within the last lines of its output, you should also find the
   device names, e.g. ``/dev/sde`` or ``/dev/mmcblk0`` (depending on your
   system).

Alternatively, you may use a graphical program of your choice, like `GNOME Disks
<https://apps.gnome.org/en/DiskUtility/>`_ or `KDE Partition Manager
<https://apps.kde.org/partitionmanager/>`_, to find the correct device.

Now that you have the correct device name, e.g. ``/dev/sde``,
you can see the partitions which must be unmounted if the SD card is formatted.
In this case, you will also find the device name with an appended number
(e.g. ``/dev/sde1``) in the output. These represent the partitions. Some Linux
distributions automatically mount partitions when the device gets plugged in.
Before writing, however, these need to be unmounted to avoid data corruption.

Unmount all those partitions, e.g.:

.. code-block:: console

   host:~$ sudo umount /dev/sde1
   host:~$ sudo umount /dev/sde2

Now, the SD card is ready to be flashed with an image, using either ``partup``,
``dd`` or ``bmap-tools``.

Using partup
............

Writing to an SD card with partup is done in a single command:

.. code-block:: console
   :substitutions:

   host:~$ sudo partup install |yocto-imagename|-|yocto-machinename|.partup /dev/<your_device>

Make sure to replace <your_device> with your actual device name found previously.

Further usage of partup is explained at its `official documentation website
<https://partup.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__.

.. note::
   *partup* has the advantage of allowing to clear specific raw areas in the
   MMC user area, which is used in our provided partup packages to erase any
   existing U-Boot environments. This is a known issue *bmaptool* does not
   solve, as mentioned below.

   Another key advantage of partup over other flashing tools is that it allows
   configuring MMC specific parts, like writing to eMMC boot partitions, without
   the need to call multiple other commands when writing.

Using bmap-tools
................

An alternative and also fast way to prepare an SD card is using
`bmap-tools <https://github.com/yoctoproject/bmaptool>`_. Yocto
automatically creates a block map file (``<IMAGENAME>-<MACHINE>.wic.bmap``) for
the WIC image that describes the image content and includes checksums for data
integrity. *bmaptool* is packaged by various Linux distributions. For
Debian-based systems install it by issuing:

.. code-block:: console

   host:~$ sudo apt install bmap-tools

Flash a WIC image to SD card by calling:

.. code-block:: console
   :substitutions:

   host:~$ bmaptool copy |yocto-imagename|-|yocto-machinename|.|yocto-imageext| /dev/<your_device>

Replace <your_device> with your actual SD card's device name found previously,
and make sure to place the file ``<IMAGENAME>-<MACHINE>.wic.bmap`` alongside
the regular WIC image file, so bmaptool knows which blocks to write and which
to skip.

.. warning::
   *bmaptool* only overwrites the areas of an SD card where image data is
   located. This means that a previously written U-Boot environment may still be
   available after writing the image.

Using ``dd``
............

After having unmounted all SD card's partitions, you can create your bootable SD card.

Some PHYTEC BSPs produce uncompressed images (with filename-extension \*.wic),
and some others produce compressed images (with filename-extension \*.wic.xz).

To flash an uncompressed images (\*.wic) use command below:

.. code-block:: console
   :substitutions:

   host:~$ sudo dd if=|yocto-imagename|-|yocto-machinename|.wic of=/dev/<your_device> bs=1M conv=fsync status=progress

Or to flash a compressed images (\*.wic.xz) use that command:

.. code-block:: console
   :substitutions:

   host:~$ xzcat |yocto-imagename|-|yocto-machinename|.wic.xz | sudo dd of=/dev/<your_device> bs=1M conv=fsync status=progress

Again, make sure to replace <your_device> with your actual device name found
previously.

The parameter ``conv=fsync`` forces a sync operation on the device before
``dd`` returns. This ensures that all blocks are written to the SD card and
none are left in memory. The parameter ``status=progress`` will print out
information on how much data is and still has to be copied until it is
finished.

First Start-up
--------------

* To boot from an SD card, |ref-bootswitch| needs to be set to the following
  position:

The following is an example of the pin muxing of the UART1 device in
|dt-carrierboard|.dts:

.. code-block::

   pinctrl_uart1: uart1grp {
           fsl,pins = <
                   MX8MN_IOMUXC_SAI2_RXFS_UART1_DCE_TX     0x00
                   MX8MN_IOMUXC_SAI2_RXC_UART1_DCE_RX      0x00
                   MX8MN_IOMUXC_SAI2_RXD0_UART1_DCE_RTS_B  0x00
                   MX8MN_IOMUXC_SAI2_TXFS_UART1_DCE_CTS_B  0x00
           >;
   };

The first part of the string MX8MN_IOMUXC_SAI2_RXFS_UART1_DCE_TX names the pad
(in this example SAI2_RXFS). The second part of the string (UART1_DCE_RX) is the
desired muxing option for this pad. The pad setting value (hex value on the right)
defines different modes of the pad, for example, if internal pull resistors are
activated or not. In this case, the internal resistors are disabled.

RS232/RS485
-----------

The |soc| SoC provides up to 4 UART units. PHYTEC boards support different
numbers of these UART units. UART1 can also be used as RS-485. For this,
|ref-bootswitch| needs to be set correctly:

.. list-table:: Switch between UART1 RS485/RS232

   *  - .. figure:: /bsp/imx8/imx8mm/images/UART1_RS485.png

USB Host Controller
-------------------

The USB controller of the |soc| SoC provides a low-cost connectivity solution
for numerous consumer portable devices by providing a mechanism for data
transfer between USB devices with a line/bus speed up to 480 Mbps (HighSpeed
'HS').

The |soc| SoC has a single USB controller core that is set to OTG mode.
To use the micro USB / OTG port dip switch S1 Pos5 has to be set to on.

.. include:: /bsp/peripherals/usb-host.rsti

.. include:: /bsp/peripherals/usb-otg.rsti

The USB interface is configured as host in the kernel device tree
|dt-carrierboard|.dts. See:

CAN FD
------

The |sbc| two flexCAN interfaces supporting CAN FD. They are supported by the
Linux standard CAN framework which builds upon then the Linux network layer.
Using this framework, the CAN interfaces behave like an ordinary Linux network
device, with some additional features special to CAN. More information can be
found in the Linux Kernel
documentation: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/networking/can.html

.. Hint::

   phyBOARD-Polis has an external CANFD chip MCP2518FD connected over SPI.
   There are different interfaces involved, which limits the datarate
   capabilities of CANFD.
