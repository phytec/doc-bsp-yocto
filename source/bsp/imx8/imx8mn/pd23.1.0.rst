Getting Started
===============

The |kit| is shipped with a pre-flashed SD card. It contains the
|yocto-imagename| and can be used directly as a boot source. The eMMC is
programmed with only a U-Boot by default. You can get all sources from the
`PHYTEC download server <dl-server_>`_. This chapter explains how to flash a BSP
image to SD card and how to start the board.

There are several ways to flash an image to SD card or even eMMC. Most notably
using simple, sequential writing with the Linux command line tool ``dd``. An
alternative way is to use PHYTEC's system initialization program called
`partup <https://github.com/phytec/partup>`_, which makes it especially easy to
format more complex systems. You can get `prebuilt Linux binaries of partup
<https://github.com/phytec/partup/releases>`__ from its release page. Also read
`partup's README <https://github.com/phytec/partup#readme>`__ for installation
instructions.

Get the Image
-------------

The image contains all necessary files and makes sure partitions and any raw
data are correctly written. Both the partup package and the WIC image, which can
be flashed using ``dd``, can be downloaded from the `PHYTEC download server
<dl-server_>`_.

Get either the partup package or the WIC image from the download server:

.. code-block:: console
   :substitutions:

   host:~$ wget |link-partup-package|
   host:~$ wget |link-image|

.. note::
   For eMMC, more complex partitioning schemes or even just large images, we
   recommend using the partup package, as it is faster in writing than ``dd``
   and allows for a more flexible configuration of the target flash device.

Write the Image to SD Card
--------------------------

.. warning::
   To create your bootable SD card, you must have root privileges on your Linux
   host PC. Be very careful when specifying the destination device! All files
   on the selected device will be erased immediately without any further query!

   Selecting the wrong device may result in **data loss** and e.g. could erase
   your currently running system on your host PC!

Finding the Correct Device
..........................

To create your bootable SD card, you must first find the correct device name
of your SD card and possible partitions. If any partitions of the SD cards are
mounted, unmount those before you start copying the image to the SD card.

#. In order to get the correct device name, remove your SD card and
   execute:

   .. code-block:: console

      host:~$ lsblk

#. Now insert your SD card and execute the command again:

   .. code-block:: console

      host:~$ lsblk

#. Compare the two outputs to find the new device names listed in the second
   output. These are the device names of the SD card (device and partitions if
   the SD card was formatted).
#. In order to verify the device names being found, execute the command
   ``sudo dmesg``. Within the last lines of its output, you should also find the
   device names, e.g. ``/dev/sde`` or ``/dev/mmcblk0`` (depending on your
   system).

Alternatively, you may use a graphical program of your choice, like `GNOME Disks
<https://apps.gnome.org/en/DiskUtility/>`_ or `KDE Partition Manager
<https://apps.kde.org/partitionmanager/>`_, to find the correct device.

Now that you have the correct device name, e.g. ``/dev/sde``,
you can see the partitions which must be unmounted if the SD card is formatted.
In this case, you will also find the device name with an appended number
(e.g. ``/dev/sde1``) in the output. These represent the partitions. Some Linux
distributions automatically mount partitions when the device gets plugged in.
Before writing, however, these need to be unmounted to avoid data corruption.

Unmount all those partitions, e.g.:

.. code-block:: console

   host:~$ sudo umount /dev/sde1
   host:~$ sudo umount /dev/sde2

Now, the SD card is ready to be flashed with an image, using either ``partup``,
``dd`` or ``bmap-tools``.

Using partup
............

Writing to an SD card with partup is done in a single command:

.. code-block:: console
   :substitutions:

   host:~$ sudo partup install |yocto-imagename|-|yocto-machinename|.partup /dev/<your_device>

Make sure to replace <your_device> with your actual device name found previously.

Further usage of partup is explained at its `official documentation website
<https://partup.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__.

.. note::
   *partup* has the advantage of allowing to clear specific raw areas in the
   MMC user area, which is used in our provided partup packages to erase any
   existing U-Boot environments. This is a known issue *bmaptool* does not
   solve, as mentioned below.

   Another key advantage of partup over other flashing tools is that it allows
   configuring MMC specific parts, like writing to eMMC boot partitions, without
   the need to call multiple other commands when writing.

Using bmap-tools
................

An alternative and also fast way to prepare an SD card is using
`bmap-tools <https://github.com/yoctoproject/bmaptool>`_. Yocto
automatically creates a block map file (``<IMAGENAME>-<MACHINE>.wic.bmap``) for
the WIC image that describes the image content and includes checksums for data
integrity. *bmaptool* is packaged by various Linux distributions. For
Debian-based systems install it by issuing:

.. code-block:: console

   host:~$ sudo apt install bmap-tools

Flash a WIC image to SD card by calling:

.. code-block:: console
   :substitutions:

   host:~$ bmaptool copy |yocto-imagename|-|yocto-machinename|.|yocto-imageext| /dev/<your_device>

Replace <your_device> with your actual SD card's device name found previously,
and make sure to place the file ``<IMAGENAME>-<MACHINE>.wic.bmap`` alongside
the regular WIC image file, so bmaptool knows which blocks to write and which
to skip.

.. warning::
   *bmaptool* only overwrites the areas of an SD card where image data is
   located. This means that a previously written U-Boot environment may still be
   available after writing the image.

Using ``dd``
............

After having unmounted all SD card's partitions, you can create your bootable SD card.

Some PHYTEC BSPs produce uncompressed images (with filename-extension \*.wic),
and some others produce compressed images (with filename-extension \*.wic.xz).

To flash an uncompressed images (\*.wic) use command below:

.. code-block:: console
   :substitutions:

   host:~$ sudo dd if=|yocto-imagename|-|yocto-machinename|.wic of=/dev/<your_device> bs=1M conv=fsync status=progress

Or to flash a compressed images (\*.wic.xz) use that command:

.. code-block:: console
   :substitutions:

   host:~$ xzcat |yocto-imagename|-|yocto-machinename|.wic.xz | sudo dd of=/dev/<your_device> bs=1M conv=fsync status=progress

Again, make sure to replace <your_device> with your actual device name found
previously.

The parameter ``conv=fsync`` forces a sync operation on the device before
``dd`` returns. This ensures that all blocks are written to the SD card and
none are left in memory. The parameter ``status=progress`` will print out
information on how much data is and still has to be copied until it is
finished.

First Start-up
--------------

* To boot from an SD card, |ref-bootswitch| needs to be set to the following
  position:

.. list-table:: Bootmode Selection
   :align: center

The following is an example of the pin muxing of the UART1 device in
|dt-carrierboard|.dts:

.. code-block::

   pinctrl_uart1: uart1grp {
           fsl,pins = <
                   MX8MN_IOMUXC_SAI2_RXFS_UART1_DCE_TX     0x00
                   MX8MN_IOMUXC_SAI2_RXC_UART1_DCE_RX      0x00
                   MX8MN_IOMUXC_SAI2_RXD0_UART1_DCE_RTS_B  0x00
                   MX8MN_IOMUXC_SAI2_TXFS_UART1_DCE_CTS_B  0x00
           >;
   };

The first part of the string MX8MN_IOMUXC_SAI2_RXFS_UART1_DCE_TX names the pad
(in this example SAI2_RXFS). The second part of the string (UART1_DCE_RX) is the
desired muxing option for this pad. The pad setting value (hex value on the right)
defines different modes of the pad, for example, if internal pull resistors are
activated or not. In this case, the internal resistors are disabled.

RS232/RS485
-----------

The |soc| SoC provides up to 4 UART units. PHYTEC boards support different
numbers of these UART units. UART1 can also be used as RS-485. For this,
|ref-bootswitch| needs to be set correctly:

.. list-table:: Switch between UART1 RS485/RS232

   *  - .. figure:: /bsp/imx8/imx8mm/images/UART1_RS485.png

GPIOs
-----

The |sbc| has a set of pins especially dedicated to user I/Os. Those pins are
connected directly to |soc| pins and are muxed as GPIOs. They are directly
usable in Linux userspace. The processor has organized its GPIOs into five banks
of 32 GPIOs each (GPIO1 – GPIO5)
GPIOs. gpiochip0, gpiochip32, gpiochip64, gpiochip96, and gpiochip128 are
the sysfs representation of these internal |soc| GPIO banks GPIO1 – GPIO5.

The GPIOs are identified as GPIO<X>_<Y> (e.g. GPIO5_07). <X> identifies the GPIO
bank and counts from 1 to 5, while <Y> stands for the GPIO within the bank. <Y>
is being counted from 0 to 31 (32 GPIOs on each bank).

By contrast, the Linux kernel uses a single integer to enumerate all available
GPIOs in the system. The formula to calculate the right number is:

.. code-block::

   Linux GPIO number: <N> = (<X> - 1) * 32 + <Y>

Accessing GPIOs from userspace will be done using the libgpiod. It provides a
library and tools for interacting with the Linux GPIO character device. Examples
of some usages of various tools:

*  Detecting the gpiochips on the chip:

   .. code-block:: console

      target:~$ gpiodetect
      gpiochip0 [30200000.gpio] (32 lines)
      gpiochip1 [30210000.gpio] (32 lines)
      gpiochip2 [30220000.gpio] (32 lines)
      gpiochip3 [30230000.gpio] (32 lines)
      gpiochip4 [30240000.gpio] (32 lines)

*  Show detailed information about the gpiochips. Like their names, consumers,
   direction, active state, and additional flags:

   .. code-block:: console

      target:~$ gpioinfo gpiochip0

*  Read the value of a GPIO (e.g GPIO 20 from chip0):

   .. code-block:: console

      target:~$ gpioget gpiochip0 20

*  Set the value of GPIO 20 on chip0 to 0 and exit tool:

   .. code-block:: console

      target:~$ gpioset --mode=exit gpiochip0 20=0

*  Help text of gpioset shows possible options:

   .. code-block:: console

      target:~$ gpioset --help
      Usage: gpioset [OPTIONS] <chip name/number> <offset1>=<value1> <offset2>=<value2> ...
      Set GPIO line values of a GPIO chip

      Options:
        -h, --help:           display this message and exit
        -v, --version:        display the version and exit
        -l, --active-low:     set the line active state to low
        -m, --mode=[exit|wait|time|signal] (defaults to 'exit'):
                      tell the program what to do after setting values
        -s, --sec=SEC:        specify the number of seconds to wait (only valid for --mode=time)
        -u, --usec=USEC:      specify the number of microseconds to wait (only valid for --mode=time)
        -b, --background:     after setting values: detach from the controlling terminal

      Modes:
        exit:         set values and exit immediately
        wait:         set values and wait for user to press ENTER
        time:         set values and sleep for a specified amount of time
        signal:       set values and wait for SIGINT or SIGTERM

      Note: the state of a GPIO line controlled over the character device reverts to default
      when the last process referencing the file descriptor representing the device file exits.
      This means that it's wrong to run gpioset, have it exit and expect the line to continue
      being driven high or low. It may happen if given pin is floating but it must be interpreted
      as undefined behavior.


.. warning::

   Some of the user IOs are used for special functions. Before using a user IO,
   refer to the schematic or the hardware manual of your board to ensure that it
   is not already in use.

EEPROM
------

On the |som| there is an i2c EEPROM flash populated. It has two addresses. The
main EEPROM space (bus: I2C-0 address: 0x51) and the ID-page (bus: I2C-0
address: 0x59) can be accessed via the sysfs interface in Linux. The first
256 bytes of the main EEPROM and the ID-page are used for board detection and
must not be overwritten. Overwriting reserved spaces will result in boot issues.

.. include:: ../peripherals/eeprom.rsti

Rescue EEPROM Data
..................

The hardware introspection data is pre-written on both EEPROM data spaces. If
you have accidentally deleted or overwritten the normal area, you can copy the
hardware introspection from the ID area to the normal area.

.. code-block:: console

   target:~$ dd if=/sys/class/i2c-dev/i2c-0/device/0-0059/eeprom of=/sys/class/i2c-dev/i2c-0/device/0-0051/eeprom bs=1

.. note::

   If you deleted both EEPROM spaces, please contact our support!

RTC Parameters
..............

RTCs have a few abilities which can be read/set with the help of ``hwclock``
tool.

*  We can check RTC supported features with:

   .. code-block:: console

      target:~$ hwclock --param-get features
      The RTC parameter 0x0 is set to 0x11.

   What this value means is encoded in kernel, each set bit translates to:

   .. code-block::

      #define RTC_FEATURE_ALARM              0
      #define RTC_FEATURE_ALARM_RES_MINUTE   1
      #define RTC_FEATURE_NEED_WEEK_DAY      2
      #define RTC_FEATURE_ALARM_RES_2S       3
      #define RTC_FEATURE_UPDATE_INTERRUPT   4
      #define RTC_FEATURE_CORRECTION         5
      #define RTC_FEATURE_BACKUP_SWITCH_MODE 6
      #define RTC_FEATURE_CNT                7

*  We can check RTC BSM (Backup Switchover Mode) with:

   .. code-block:: console

      target:~$ hwclock --param-get bsm
      The RTC parameter 0x2 is set to 0x1.

*  We can set RTC BSM with:

   .. code-block:: console

      target:~$ hwclock --param-set bsm=0x2
      The RTC parameter 0x2 will be set to 0x2.

   What BSM values mean translates to these values:

   .. code-block::

      #define RTC_BSM_DISABLED   0
      #define RTC_BSM_DIRECT     1
      #define RTC_BSM_LEVEL      2
      #define RTC_BSM_STANDBY    3

   .. tip::
      You should set BSM mode to DSM or LSM for RTC to switch to backup power
      source when the initial power source is not available. Check **RV-3028** RTC
      datasheet to read what LSM (Level Switching Mode) and DSM (Direct Switching
      Mode) actually mean.

USB Host Controller
-------------------

The USB controller of the |soc| SoC provides a low-cost connectivity solution
for numerous consumer portable devices by providing a mechanism for data
transfer between USB devices with a line/bus speed up to 480 Mbps (HighSpeed
'HS').

The |soc| SoC has a single USB controller core that is set to OTG mode.
To use the micro USB / OTG port dip switch S1 Pos5 has to be set to on.

.. include:: /bsp/peripherals/usb-host.rsti

.. include:: /bsp/peripherals/usb-otg.rsti

The USB interface is configured as host in the kernel device tree
|dt-carrierboard|.dts. See:
:imx-dt:`imx8mn-phyboard-polis.dts?h=v5.15.71_2.2.2-phy3#n264`

CAN FD
------

The |sbc| two flexCAN interfaces supporting CAN FD. They are supported by the
Linux standard CAN framework which builds upon then the Linux network layer.
Using this framework, the CAN interfaces behave like an ordinary Linux network
device, with some additional features special to CAN. More information can be
found in the Linux Kernel
documentation: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/networking/can.html

.. Hint::

   phyBOARD-Polis has an external CANFD chip MCP2518FD connected over SPI.
   There are different interfaces involved, which limits the datarate
   capabilities of CANFD.

.. Hint::

   On phyBOARD-Polis-i.MX8MN a terminating resistor can be enabled by setting
   S5 to ON if required.
