Creating new DIP switch graphics
================================

The DIP switch images are Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG), created using
`Inkscape <https://inkscape.org/>`_. Install Inkscape from your package manager
(apt, pacman, etc.) under Linux or download it from the website if using
Windows. If you are new to Inkscape, `read the basic tutorials
<https://inkscape.org/learn/tutorials/>`_ to get familiar with the usage!

-  When creating a new DIP switch, which doesn't exist already, take
   ``source/bsp/images/dipswitch-4-0000.svg`` or similar as a base to modify.
-  Open the SVG with Inkscape.
-  Activate snapping in Inkscape.
-  Move the white knobs to their correct position (on/off, up/down), while
   utilizing the automatic snapping of Inkscape.
-  Do not move any other components than the white knobs.
-  The colors should be kept the same for all components (body, knobs, text,
   leads, etc.).
-  The outer dimensions of the DIP switch should match the real component 1:1.
