msgid "Introduction"

msgid "Most modern SoCs include one of more coprocessors beside an application processor. In most cases the application processor runs Linux, while the coprocessor may run an RTOS. This manuals goes into detail how to utilize the coprocessor efficiently for projects."

msgid "OpenAMP"
msgstr ""

msgid "The `OpenAMP <http://openampproject.org>`_ Project which \"seeks to standardize the interactions between operating environments in a heterogeneous embedded system through open source solutions for Asymmetric MultiProcessing (AMP).\" This introduction explains the main components and terms, the `OpenAMP documentation <https://openamp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/openamp/index.html>`_ goes into further detail. OpenAMP is available in Linux as well as in RTOS (e.g. Zephyr) and Vendor SDKs (e.g. NXP MCUX, TI SDK, STM32Cube). The OpenAMP framework consists of several components:"

msgid "Components"
msgstr ""

msgid "Shared Memory"
msgstr ""

msgid "In SoCs, where coprocessors are integrated on the same die they typically communicate by exchanging data via sharing memory sections."
msgstr ""

msgid "Interrupts"
msgstr ""

msgid "Minimum set of one interrupt line per communicating core. This interrupt is often implemented in hardware blocks of the SoC, e.g. the \"Messaging Unit (MU)\" on the NXP i.MX8MP."
msgstr ""

msgid "remoteproc"
msgstr ""

msgid "Life Cycle Management (LCM) to manage and update the software running on coprocessors. The `remoteproc documentation <https://docs.kernel.org/staging/remoteproc.html>`_ on Kernel.org goes into further technical details."
msgstr ""

msgid "RPMsg"
msgstr ""

msgid "Exchange of messages, api that enables Inter Processor Communications (IPC). The `rpmsg documentation <https://docs.kernel.org/staging/rpmsg.html>`_ on Kernel.org goes into further technical details."
msgstr ""

msgid "VirtIO, Virtqueue, Vring"
msgstr ""

msgid "**VirtIO** provides a standardized framework for efficient message exchange between processing units using virtualization. **Virtqueue** is the abstract structure that manages the queues of messages and buffers for communication between these units. **Vring** is the specific circular buffer implementation used within a Virtqueue that organizes the descriptors for the messages being exchanged. There are ringbuffers for both directions (read, write). This set of infrastructure components can be used in combination with RPMsg to improve performance and reduce synchronization between Cores."

msgid "Furthermore, remoteproc only reads firmware files from the ``/lib/firmware`` directory. Loading firmware binaries from another location will result in errors."
