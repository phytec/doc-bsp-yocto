msgid "Yocto is the smallest SI metric system prefix. Like milli equates to ``m = 10^-3``, and so is yocto ``y = 10^-24``. Yocto is also a project working group of the `Linux Foundation <https://www.linuxfoundation.org/>`_ and therefore backed up by several major companies in the field. On the `Yocto Project website <https://www.yoctoproject.org/>`_ you can read the official introduction:"
msgstr ""

msgid "The Yocto Project is an open-source collaboration project that provides templates, tools, and methods to help you create custom Linux-based systems for embedded products regardless of the hardware architecture. It was founded in 2010 as a collaboration among many hardware manufacturers, open-source operating systems vendors, and electronics companies to bring some order to the chaos of embedded Linux development."
msgstr ""

msgid "As said, the project wants to provide toolsets for embedded developers. It builds on top of the long-lasting `OpenEmbedded <https://www.openembedded.org/wiki/Main_Page>`_ project. It is not a Linux distribution. But it contains the tools to create a Linux distribution specially fitted to the product requirements. The most important step in bringing order to the set of tools is to define a common versioning scheme and a reference system. All subprojects have then to comply with the reference system and have to comply with the versioning scheme."
msgstr ""

msgid "The release process is similar to the `Linux kernel <https://kernel.org/>`_. Yocto increases its version number every six months and gives the release a codename. The release list can be found here: https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Releases"

It describes how to package the software, e.g. into different .deb packages, which then contain the installation path.

msgid "PHYTEC BSP Introduction"
msgstr ""

msgid "BSP Structure"
msgstr ""

msgid "The BSP consists roughly of three parts. BSP management, BSP metadata, and BSP content. The management consists of *Repo* and phyLinux while the metadata depends on the SOC, which describes how to build the software. The content comprises PHYTEC's *Git* repositories and external sources."
msgstr ""

msgid "BSP Management"
msgstr ""

msgid "*Yocto* is an umbrella project. Naturally, this will force the user to base their work on several external repositories. They need to be managed in a deterministic way. We use manifest files, which contain an XML data structure, to describe all git repositories with pinned-down versions. The *Repo* tool and our phyLinux wrapper script are used to manage the manifests and set up the BSP, as described in the manifest file."
msgstr ""

msgid "phyLinux"
msgstr ""

msgid "phyLinux is a wrapper for *Repo* to handle downloading and setting up the BSP with an \"out of the box\" experience."
msgstr ""

msgid "Repo"
msgstr ""

msgid "*Repo* is a wrapper around the *Repo* toolset. The phyLinux script will install the wrapper in a global path. This is only a wrapper, though. Whenever you run ``repo init -u <url>``, you first download the *Repo* tools from *Googles* Git server in a specific version to the ``.repo/repo`` directory. The next time you run *Repo*, all the commands will be available. Be aware that the *Repo* version in different build directories can differ over the years if you do not run *Repo sync*. Also if you store information for your archives, you need to include the complete ``.repo`` folder."
msgstr ""

msgid "*Repo* expects a *Git* repository which will be parsed from the command line. In the PHYTEC BSP, it is called phy²octo. In this repository, all information about a software BSP release is stored in the form of a *Repo* XML manifest. This data structure defines URLs of *Git* servers (called \"remotes\") and *Git* repositories and their states (called \"projects\"). The *Git* repositories can be seen in different states. The revision field can be a branch, tag, or commit id of a repository. This means the state of the software is not necessarily unique and can change over time. That is the reason we use only tags or commit ids for our releases. The state of the working directory is then unique and does not change."
msgstr ""

msgid "The manifests for the releases have the same name as the release itself. It is a unique identifier for the complete BSP. The releases are sorted by the SoC platform. The selected SoC will define the branch of the phy²octo *Git* repository which will be used for the manifest selection."
msgstr ""

msgid "BSP Metadata"
msgstr ""

msgid "We include several third-party layers in our BSP to get a complete *Linux* distribution up and running without the need to integrate external projects. All used repositories are described in the following section."
msgstr ""

msgid "The PHYTEC BSP is built on top of *Poky*. It comes with a specific version, defined in the *Repo* manifest. *Poky* comes with a specific version of *Bitbake*. The OpenEmbedded-core layer \"meta\" is used as a base for our *Linux* system."

msgstr ""

msgid "site.conf Setup"
msgstr ""

msgid "Before starting the *Yocto* build, it is advisable to configure the development setup. Two things are most important: the download directory and the cache directory. PHYTEC strongly recommends configuring the setup as it will reduce the compile time of consequent builds."
msgstr ""

msgid "A download directory is a place where *Yocto* stores all sources fetched from the internet. It can contain tar.gz, *Git* mirror, etc. It is very useful to set this to a common shared location on the machine. Create this directory with 777 access rights. To share this directory with different users, all files need to have group write access. This will most probably be in conflict with default *umask* settings. One possible solution would be to use ACLs for this directory"

msgid "If you have already created a download directory and want to fix the permissions afterward, you can do so with"

Check out the `OpenEmbedded MetaData Index <https://layers.openembedded.org/layerindex/branch/kirkstone/layers/>`_ and guess a little bit. The network scanner *nmap* is in the *meta-security* layer. See `meta-security on layers.openembedded.org <https://layers.openembedded.org/layerindex/branch/kirkstone/layer/meta-security/>`_. To integrate it into the *Yocto* build, you have to check out the repository and then switch to the correct stable branch.

If you want to benefit from those changes and are, in general, satisfied with the userspace configuration, it could be the best solution to create your own layer on top of *Ampliphy*. If you need to rework a lot of information and only need the basic hardware support from PHYTEC, it would be better to copy *meta-ampliphy*, rename it, and adapt it to your needs. You can also have a look at the OpenEmbedded layer index to find different distribution layers. If you just need to add your own application to the image, create your own layer."

Check out the `OpenEmbedded MetaData Index <https://layers.openembedded.org/layerindex/branch/scarthgap/layers/>`_ and guess a little bit. The network scanner *nmap* is in the *meta-security* layer. See `meta-security on layers.openembedded.org <https://layers.openembedded.org/layerindex/branch/scarthgap/layer/meta-security/>`_. To integrate it into the *Yocto* build, you have to check out the repository and then switch to the correct stable branch.
