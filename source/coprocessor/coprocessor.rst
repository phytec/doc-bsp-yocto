Introduction
============

Most modern SoCs include one or more coprocessors beside an application
processor. In most cases the application processor runs Linux, while the
coprocessor may run an RTOS. This manual goes into detail how to utilize the
coprocessor efficiently for projects.

The manual explains generic principles and applies those principles in examples
for a specific platform and tools. It gives an introduction into
coprocessor software stacks and RTOS like Zephyr, MCUXpresso and OpenAMP

For now this manual is focused on the NXP i.MX platform,
but an attempt is made to keep the manual as generic as possible.

Internal vs. External Coprocessor
---------------------------------

A coprocessor can be internal or external (Of the application processors SoC).
Both have their advantages and disadvantages. Advantages on internal
coprocessors are for example a more simple firmware update management,
a more efficient communication between the coprocessor and the application
processor and a probably more inexpensive PCB design.
External coprocessors have, for example, the advantages of more interfaces in
addition to the ones of the application processor, and they are starting up
directly, not depending on the application processor.

This manual focuses on internal coprocessors of the PHYTEC SoMs.

Use Cases
---------

There are several use cases for coprocessors in embedded systems. Almost every
time-critical task that cannot be handled by the application processor can be
offloaded to a coprocessor.

Here are some more explicit use-case examples to give an idea of the
possibilities:

Energy Constrained Applications
...............................

For energy constrained applications, it may be beneficial to reduce the active
time of the entire SoC to conserve power. In such cases, the application
processor can be put into sleep mode while the coprocessor remains active to,
for example, monitor I2C communication and wake up the application processor
upon receiving a specific command.


Time-Critical Communication
...........................

Some protocols may require sending or receiving data in real-time. If there is
no hardware IP-core that is capable of handling the desired protocol, the
coprocessor could help out to support it through building it in software.

Sensors and Real-Time
.....................

Some applications may require a sensor to be read in a time-critical manner
(e.g. an accelerometer) to detect small value changes in a short time frame.
This can be done by a coprocessor to ensure that the sensor is read at the
right time. The data can be buffered and fed to the application processor if
it has time to process the data.

Interface Virtualization
........................

On SoCs like the i.MX9 series there is the FLEXIO interface
(compare RPi PIO, Microchip CLC). Received data on this interface needs to be
processed in a time-critical manner because it is lacking a FIFO buffer.
If serial data with higher speeds is received, the application processor
may need to process too many interrupts. That could slow down other running
applications. Another problem is the interrupt latency. The application
processor could possibly lose data frames.

The coprocessor can be used to read the data from the interface, buffer it
and send it to the application processor when it has time to process it.

Overview of Technologies
========================

Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS) and Development Frameworks
-------------------------------------------------------------

There are multiple RTOS and SDKs available that can be used on coprocessors.

Zephyr
......

Zephyr is an Open Source and vendor neutral RTOS that is is governed by the
Linux Foundation and supported by various companies and a large community.
It is designed to be small and efficient and is suitable for a wide range of
devices from simple embedded devices to complex SoCs.
The key feature is the platform independence, which allows developing
applications with a generic API that can run on multiple platforms without
modification.

It supports a wide range of SoCs and boards from various manufacturers
based on different processor architectures. There is also support for a lot
of different peripherals and interfaces,
as well as a wide range of communication protocols.
(e.g. TCP/IP stack, Bluetooth, CAN, USB, etc.)

Zephyr supports the coprocessor on multiple phyBOARDs,
including the phyBOARD Pollux (i.MX8MP), Polis (i.MX8MM), Nash (i.MX93),
Electra (AM64x) and Lyra (AM62x).

It should be mentioned, that not all hardware features are available in Zephyr
yet. The support is constantly being expanded through NXP and the Zephyr
community. Despite this PHYTEC recommends using Zephyr for new projects because
of its many advantages.

You can find more information about using Zephyr in the `Zephyr Documentation
<https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/introduction/index.html>`_ website.

.. hint::
   Please reach out to us if there is any feature missing in Zephyr that you
   need for your project. We will try our best to get that feature implemented.

MCUXpresso SDK (NXP)
....................

The MCUX SDK is a software development kit for NXP microcontrollers and
microprocessors. It provides a comprehensive set of peripheral drivers,
middlewares and examples for all NXP Platforms.
MCUX gives the possibility to use different RTOS like FreeRTOS, Azure RTOS
or even using it BareMetal.

If Zephyr is not suitable for your project (e.g. because of missing features),
MCUX SDK is the alternative. You can use it either with the MCUX SDK
or repository-managed via make and cpp.

Here are some resources to get started with MCUX:

- `MCUXpresso SDK <https://www.nxp.com/design/software/development-software/mcuxpresso-software-and-tools/mcuxpresso-software-development-kit-sdk:MCUXpresso-SDK>`_

- `PHYTEC MCUX-SDK <https://github.com/phytec/mcux-sdk>`_

- `MCUXpresso VS-Code IDE <https://www.nxp.com/design/design-center/training/TIP-GETTING-STARTED-WITH-MCUXPRESSO-FOR-VS-CODE>`_

- `MCUXpresso IDE <https://www.nxp.com/design/software/development-software/mcuxpresso-software-and-tools/mcuxpresso-integrated-development-environment-ide:MCUXpresso-IDE>`_

Additional Software Stacks
--------------------------

OpenAMP
.......


The `OpenAMP <http://openampproject.org>`_ Project "seeks to standardize
the interactions between operating environments in a heterogeneous embedded
system through open source solutions for Asymmetric MultiProcessing (AMP)."

This introduction explains the main components and terms, the `OpenAMP
documentation <https://openamp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/openamp/index.html>`_
goes into further detail.
OpenAMP is available in Linux as well as in RTOS
(e.g. Zephyr) and Vendor SDKs (e.g. NXP MCUX, TI SDK, STM32Cube).

In general, OpenAMP is a framework that allows communication between
asymmetric processor cores inside a SoC via shared memory.

A differentiation is made between a master core
(mostly the application processor) and one or more remote cores (coprocessors).
The master core has to load the firmware on the remote core, start it and
prepare shared memory regions for communication.

The OpenAMP framework consists of two main components:

remoteproc
^^^^^^^^^^

The remoteproc framework is used to control the life cycle of a remote
processor. It is responsible for loading the firmware, starting and stopping
the remote processor and managing the resources of both cores.
The `remoteproc documentation <https://docs.kernel.org/staging/remoteproc.html>`_
on Kernel.org goes into further technical details.

RPMsg
^^^^^

RPMsg is a messaging protocol that is used to exchange messages between the
master core and remote cores. It is built on top of VirtIO and Virtqueue and
uses the shared memory regions prepared by remoteproc to exchange messages.

The communication stack is consisting of several protocol layers, similar
to the OSI model:

Transport Layer (3):
   RPMsg

MAC Layer (2):
   VirtIO, Virtqueue, Vring

Physical Layer (1):
   Shared Memory, Inter-core Interrupts e.g. via Messaging Unit (MU)


Normally VirtIO is used to exchange messages between virtual machines in
a hypervisor environment. In the context of OpenAMP, VirtIO is used to
exchange messages between the master core and remote cores while
being very efficient. The Virtqueue is underlying VirtIO and
organizes the messages in a circular buffer. The Vring is the specific
implementation of the buffer inside the Virtqueue.

The `rpmsg documentation <https://docs.kernel.org/staging/rpmsg.html>`_
on Kernel.org goes into further technical details.


Requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Shared Memory
    To exchange messages between the cores, a shared memory region is required.

Interrupts
    Minimum set of one interrupt line per communicating core. This interrupt is
    often implemented in hardware blocks of the SoC, e.g. the "Messaging Unit
    (MU)" on the NXP i.MX8MP.

Resource Table
    The resource table is a data structure that describes the shared memory
    regions and the VirtIO devices that are used for communication between the
    cores. It is used by the remoteproc framework to prepare the shared memory
    regions and the VirtIO devices. Ensure that the resource table is correctly
    included in the firmware binary of the remote core.
    (e.g. in Zephyr use ``CONFIG_OPENAMP_RSC_TABLE=y``)


Protocol Buffers
................


Application Architectures
=========================

Typical Usage
-------------

.. figure:: images/openamp_typical_usage.png
   :alt: Typical Usage

   Typical Application Architecture with OpenAMP (source: `OpenAMP Whitepaper
   <https://www.openampproject.org/docs/whitepapers/Introduction_to_OpenAMPlib_v1.1a.pdf>`_)


A typical application architecture when using OpenAMP is using two cores.
One application processor (typically running Linux) while the coprocessor
is processing time-critical tasks.

VirtIO
------

RPmsg + Overlaying Protocol
---------------------------

Sometimes it can be necessary to use an overlaying protocol on top of RPMsg
to exchange more complex data structures.

This could be done with using a protocol like `Protocol Buffers
<https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers>`_ or `Flat Buffers
<https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/>`_ to serialize and deserialize the
data structures.

Getting Started
===============

There are multiple ways to get started with using a coprocessor.

First of all you need to decide which RTOS you want to use.

If you want to use Zephyr, you can use the `Zephyr Getting Started Guide
<https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/getting_started/index.html>`_.

.. note::

   When building a Zephyr project / sample for a SoC, the board naming can be
   confusing. The naming convention is ``<board>/<soc>/<core>``. For example,
   to build a Zephyr project for the phyBOARD Pollux (i.MX8MP) with the
   M7 core, the board name is ``phyboard_pollux/mimx8ml8/m7``.

When compiling the firmware, you'll get two binary files. One ``.elf`` file for
starting the remote processor via remoteproc, which includes the resource
table, and one ``.bin`` file for starting the remote processor via the
bootloader.


Starting the Coprocessor via Remoteproc
---------------------------------------

To start a remote processor via remoteproc, you need to place
the firmware into the ``/lib/firmware`` directory on the target.

This can be done using SCP (e.g., for development), by copying the file to the
SD card, or by including it in the Yocto build (e.g., for production use).

Make sure the devicetree overlay that enables remoteproc support is activated.
You can find more information about how to activate the devicetree overlay in
the BSP manual for your platform.

.. code-block:: console

   target:~$ echo /lib/firmware/{your_firmware}.elf > /sys/class/remoteproc/remoteproc0/firmware
   target:~$ echo start > /sys/class/remoteproc/remoteproc0/state


.. hint::

   If your device has multiple coprocessors, please make sure you use the
   correct remoteproc device.


Starting the Coprocessor via Bootloader
---------------------------------------

Starting the Coprocessor via the bootloader is platform specific.
You can find more information in the BSP manual for your platform.

Using this method can be useful, if you want to have the coprocessor running
before the application processor boots up, for example for applications that
need to have a fast response time on startup.

Here is the manual for the i.MX8MP for example:
`Running the M7 Core <https://phytec.github.io/doc-bsp-yocto/bsp/imx8/imx8mp/head.html#running-mcore-examples>`_


Starting the Coprocessor via Debug Probe
----------------------------------------

It is possible to start the coprocessor via a debug probe like J-Link or
OpenOCD. This is useful for debugging the firmware on the coprocessor, or
for starting up the coprocessor in a development environment.

On most PHYTEC boards, you can use a PEB-EVAL-01 shield to connect the
debug probe to the board via a 20-pin JTAG connector.

When using Zephyr you can simply use the command

.. code-block:: console

   host:zephyrproject/zephyr$ west debug

to start gdb and load / start the firmware on the coprocessor.


.. warning::

   Please note that it is not possible to use inter processor communication via
   RPMsg when not starting the coprocessor via remoteproc!
   This is because remoteproc prepares Linux and the shared memory for
   communication!

   This is especially impractical when you want to debug your
   coprocessor firmware via a debug probe, if your system requires the
   use of communication between the cores.


Accessing the serial console
----------------------------

The coprocessor firmware can output messages via a serial console.
It differs from platform to platform how to gain access to the serial console.

For example, on the i.MX8 platform, you'll get a serial console via the
debug USB port on the board.
On i.MX93 (on segin board) on the other hand, you can access it via RS232
on the PEB-EVAL-01.

It's recommended to take a look into the corresponding BSP or Zephyr
manual for your platform to find out how to access the serial console.

Zephyr offers a shell backend to be able to access a shell via RPMsg.
This can help for debugging purposes or to send commands to the coprocessor.
Take a look here: :ref:`openamp-using-resource-table`

The easiest way to communicate on the Linux side through RPMsg is via the
``tty-rpmsg`` driver. This driver creates a tty device in ``/dev`` that can
be used to send and receive messages to the coprocessor.


Examples and Resources
======================

This section gives an overview of examples and resources that can be used
to get started with a coprocessor.

The examples are focused on the NXP i.MX platform and Zephyr for now, but the
principles can be applied to other platforms as well.

**Resources:**

* `NXP AN5317 - Loading code to Coprocessor <https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/application-note/AN5317.pdf>`_
* `Zephyr IPC Samples <https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/samples/subsys/ipc/ipc.html>`_


Hello World
-----------

The `hello_world <https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/samples/hello_world/README.html>`_
sample is a simple example Zephyr project, that prints "Hello World!" to the
serial console.

Run the Sample
..............

1. Make sure the devicetree overlay ``imx8mp-phycore-rpmsg.dtbo`` is activated,
   the BSP manual for your platform explains how to activate this.

2. Restart the target and execute in U-Boot:

   .. code-block::

      u-boot=> run prepare_mcore

3. Save the environment in U-Boot in order to enable the m-core on every boot
   by default. Executing ``saveenv`` twice will save the environment to the
   redundant MMC partition as well.

   .. code-block::

      u-boot=> saveenv
      Saving Environment to MMC... Writing to MMC(1)... OK
      u-boot=> saveenv
      Saving Environment to MMC... Writing to redundant MMC(1)... OK

3. The target will now boot and you can build and flash the Zephyr application
   with:

   .. code-block:: console

      host:zephyrproject/zephyr$ west build -b phyboard_pollux/mimx8ml8/m7 samples/hello_world -p

4. Zephyr should now boot with

   .. code-block:: console

      target_m7:~$ *** Booting Zephyr OS build v3.7.0 ***
                   Hello World! phyboard_pollux/mimx8ml8/m7


.. _openamp-using-resource-table:

OpenAMP using resource table
----------------------------

The `openamp_rsc_table
<https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/samples/subsys/ipc/openamp_rsc_table/README.html>`_
sample "demonstrates how to use OpenAMP with Zephyr based on a resource table.
It is designed to respond to [..]" the `rpmsg client
<https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/samples/rpmsg/rpmsg_client_sample.c>`_
and `rpmsg tty
<https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/drivers/tty/rpmsg_tty.c>`_
samples in the Linux Kernel. This sample demonstrates communication between
Zephyr (coprocessor) and Linux (application processor) using OpenAMP. It
creates the two RPMsg endpoints:

rpmsg-client-sample
   Demonstrates generic RPMsg message exchange (Ping-pong) between Zephyr and
   Linux.

rpmsg-tty
   A TTY service that virtualizes a serial connection at `/dev/rpmsg-tty` in
   Linux, facilitating data exchange with Zephyr over this virtualized
   interface.

Prepare Linux
.............

The example has been tested with the imx8mp and the
`BSP-Yocto-NXP-i.MX8MP-PD24.1.0
<https://www.phytec.de/bsp-download/?bsp=BSP-Yocto-NXP-i.MX8MP-PD24.1.0>`_.
However, some modifications are necessary to be able to communicate in between
Zephyr and Linux with RPMsg. The devicetree overlay that enables rpmsg has to
be enabled. You can edit this line directly in bootenv.txt in the boot
partition.

Prepare Zephyr
..............

The sample needs some board specific settings and a devicetree overlay for the
phyBOARD Pollux. This will be upstreamed soon and maybe it is possible to make
the Zephyr sample fully generic.

You can see a branch with the required changes `here
<https://github.com/PHYTEC-Messtechnik-GmbH/sdk-zephyr/tree/WIP/j.remmert%40phytec.de/openamp_rsc_pollux>`_.

Run the Sample
..............

1. Make sure the devicetree overlay ``imx8mp-phycore-rpmsg.dtbo`` is activated,
   the BSP manual for your platform explains how to activate this.

2. Restart the target and execute in U-Boot:

   .. code-block::

      u-boot=> run prepare_mcore

3. Build Zephyr and copy the firmware to ``/lib/firmware`` on the target:

   .. code-block:: console

      host:zephyrproject/zephyr$ west build -b phyboard_pollux/mimx8ml8/m7 samples/subsys/ipc/openamp_rsc_table/ -p

4. Start the Zephyr application with remoteproc:

   .. code-block:: console

      root@phyboard-pollux-imx8mp-3:~# echo stop > /sys/class/remoteproc/remoteproc0/state
      root@phyboard-pollux-imx8mp-3:~# echo /lib/firmware/zephyr_openamp_rsc_table.elf > /sys/class/remoteproc/remoteproc0/firmware
      root@phyboard-pollux-imx8mp-3:~# echo start > /sys/class/remoteproc/remoteproc0/state

4. Zephyr should now boot now. The kernel module ``rpmsg_client_sample`` should
   load automatically and respond to the running m-core.

   .. code-block:: console

      target_m7:~$ *** Booting Zephyr OS build v4.0.0-870-g6d87bd65aebf ***
                   I: Starting application threads!

                   I: [Linux sample client] incoming msg 1: hello world!
                   D: mailbox_notify: msg received

5. If the the kernel Module does not load automatically, you can manually load
   it:

   .. code-block:: console

      target:~$ modprobe rpmsg_client_sample
      target:~$ dmesg | tail                         # Check module messages
      target:~$ modprobe -u rpmsg_client_sample      # Unload Kernel module


**Serial Communication**

Once the demo is running, it opens two serial devices (``/dev/ttyRPMSG0``,
``/dev/ttyRPMSG1``), one to send/receive any messages to Zephyr and one for the
Zephyr shell backend.

.. code-block:: console

   # Open the tty channel
   root@phyboard-pollux-imx8mp-3:~# cat /dev/ttyRPMSG1 &
   [3] 504
   root@phyboard-pollux-imx8mp-3:~# echo "Hello Zephyr" >/dev/ttyRPMSG1
   root@phyboard-pollux-imx8mp-3:~# TTY 0x0402: Hello Zephyr
   TTY 0x0402: Hello Zephyr

   # Open the Zephyr shell with micocom
   root@phyboard-pollux-imx8mp-3:~# microcom /dev/ttyRPMSG0

   clear    device   devmem   help     history  kernel   rem      resize
   retval   shell
   ipc:~$

.. note::

   Remoteproc ensures to register the resource table and the RPMsg service.
   Running firmware via debug probe is not possible when using RPMsg.

.. warning::

   Remoteproc only reads firmware files from the ``/lib/firmware`` directory!
   If you try to load a binary from another location errors will occur!

Other Examples
--------------

The following examples exist in Zephyr, however, they are specific to SoCs that
have multiple instances of Zephyr running in the same SoC. They are partly
related to Zephyrs
`ipc_service <https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/services/ipc/ipc_service/ipc_service.html>`_ and not suitable for communication with Linux.

`OpenAMP Sample
<https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/samples/subsys/ipc/openamp/README.html#openamp>`_

   sample builds different images for two targets running Zephyr. Both targets
   setup virtqueue and virtio and communicate with each other via RPMsg. This
   sample is mainly used to evaluate SoCs with two Cortex M devices and can not
   be used with Linux.

`openamp-system-reference <https://github.com/OpenAMP/openamp-system-reference>`_

   Several samples for both platforms, Linux and Zephyr that demonstrate
   different aspects of OpenAMP.

`Samples in ipc_service/ <https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/samples/subsys/ipc/ipc.html>`_

   Examples related to Zephyr ipc_service subsystem. Note that not all of those
   examples may be applicable to heterogeneous systems with one core running
   Linux and the other Zephyr.

Current Problems
================

This section lists current problems that need work.

1. Shell not working in Zephyr for Linux SoCs.

   There may be a problem with interrupts and nxp deactivated the shell for the
   imx8qm  boards. https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/pull/79428
