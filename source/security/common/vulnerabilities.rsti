Security Vulnerabilities
========================

The used software can be affected by security vulnerabilities.
A security vulnerability generally is a bug in software code that could allow
an attacker to gain control of a system. It is essential to check the software
regularly against published security flaws (Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures).

The OpenEmbedded Core layer has a cve-check class to check the recipes against
public CVEs. With this CVE check you get a list of all CVEs for the version of
the package. Only the CVEs with a Patch with the name of the CVE in the recipe
or CVEs in a Whitelists can be marked as fixed. There is no code analysis and
you must start for every check a new yocto build.

CycloneDX SBOM
--------------

`CycloneDX <https://cyclonedx.org/>`_ is an international Standard
(`ECMA-424 <https://ecma-international.org/publications-and-standards/standards/ecma-424/>`_)
for Bill of Materials and makes it simple to detect, triage, and report
security vulnerabilities. The CycloneDX is in
`JSON Format <https://cyclonedx.org/docs/1.6/json/>`_ and the component
identifiers CPE and PURL enables the detection of known
vulnerabilities. In the PHYTEC BSP you can activate the creation of a
CycloneDX SBOM in your *local.conf*:

.. code-block:: bash

   # include the sbom-cyclonedx class for SBOM creation
   INHERIT += "sbom-cyclonedx"
   # add information as property in the component
   CYCLONEDX_EXPORT_PROPERTIES ?= "SRC_URI SRCREV"
   # add config and built file names for kernel and bootloader
   CYCLONEDX_WITH_BUILDINFOS ?= "1"

This generated SBOM has information about the bootloader and kernel build for
code based CVE Analysis, which you can order as a service from PHYTEC.
