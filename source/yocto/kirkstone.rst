PHYTEC Documentation
--------------------

PHYTEC will provide a variety of hardware and software documentation for all of
our products. This includes any or all of the following:

-  **QS Guide**: A short guide on how to set up and boot a phyCORE board along
   with brief information on building a BSP, the device tree, and accessing
   peripherals.
-  **Hardware Manual**: A detailed description of the System on Module and
   accompanying carrier board.
-  **Yocto Guide**: A comprehensive guide for the Yocto version the phyCORE
   uses. This guide contains an overview of Yocto; introducing, installing, and
   customizing the PHYTEC BSP; how to work with programs like Poky and Bitbake;
   and much more.
-  **BSP Manual**: A manual specific to the BSP version of the phyCORE.
   Information such as how to build the BSP, booting, updating software, device
   tree, and accessing peripherals can be found here.
-  **Development Environment Guide**: This guide shows how to work with the
   Virtual Machine (VM) Host PHYTEC has developed and prepared to run various
   Development Environments. There are detailed step-by-step instructions for
   Eclipse and Qt Creator, which are included in the VM. There are instructions
   for running demo projects for these programs on a phyCORE product as well.
   Information on how to build a Linux host PC yourself is also a part of this
   guide.
-  **Pin Muxing Table**: phyCORE SOMs have an accompanying pin table (in Excel
   format). This table will show the complete default signal path, from
   processor to carrier board. The default device tree muxing option will also
   be included. This gives a developer all the information needed in one
   location to make muxing changes and design options when developing a
   specialized carrier board or adapting a PHYTEC phyCORE SOM to an application.

On top of these standard manuals and guides, PHYTEC will also provide Product
Change Notifications, Application Notes, and Technical Notes. These will be done
on a case-by-case basis. Most of the documentation can be found in the
applicable download page of our products.

Yocto Introduction
------------------

Yocto is the smallest SI metric system prefix. Like milli equates to ``m =
10^-3``, and so is yocto ``y = 10^-24``. Yocto is also a project working group
of the `Linux Foundation <https://www.linuxfoundation.org/>`_ and therefore
backed up by several major companies in the field. On the `Yocto Project website
<https://www.yoctoproject.org/>`_ you can read the official introduction:

   The Yocto Project is an open-source collaboration project that provides
   templates, tools, and methods to help you create custom Linux-based systems
   for embedded products regardless of the hardware architecture. It was founded
   in 2010 as a collaboration among many hardware manufacturers, open-source
   operating systems vendors, and electronics companies to bring some order to
   the chaos of embedded Linux development.

As said, the project wants to provide toolsets for embedded developers. It
builds on top of the long-lasting `OpenEmbedded
<https://www.openembedded.org/wiki/Main_Page>`_ project. It is not a Linux
distribution. But it contains the tools to create a Linux distribution
specially fitted to the product requirements. The most important step in
bringing order to the set of tools is to define a common versioning scheme and
a reference system. All subprojects have then to comply with the reference
system and have to comply with the versioning scheme.

The release process is similar to the `Linux kernel <https://kernel.org/>`_.
Yocto increases its version number every six months and gives the release a
codename. The release list can be found here:
https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Releases

Core Components
---------------

The most important tools or subprojects of the *Yocto* Project are:

-  Bitbake: build engine, a task scheduler like make, interprets metadata
-  OpenEmbedded-Core, a set of base layers, containing metadata of software, no
   sources
-  Yocto kernel

   -  Optimized for embedded devices
   -  Includes many subprojects: rt-kernel, vendor patches
   -  The infrastructure provided by Wind River
   -  Alternative: classic kernel build â†’ we use it to integrate our kernel into
      *Yocto*

-  *Yocto* Reference BSP: *beagleboneblack*, *minnow max*
-  *Poky*, the reference system, a collection of projects and tools, used to
   bootstrap a new distribution based on *Yocto*

Vocabulary
----------

Recipes
.......

Recipes contain information about the software project (author, homepage, and
license). A recipe is versioned, defines dependencies, contains the URL of the
source code, and describes how to fetch, configure, and compile the sources. It
describes how to package the software, e.g. into different .deb packages, which
then contain the installation path. Recipes are basically written in *Bitbake's*
own programming language, which has a simple syntax. However, a recipe can
contain *Python* as well as a bash code.

Classes
.......

Classes combine functionality used inside recipes into reusable blocks.

Layers
......

A layer is a collection of recipes, classes, and configuration metadata.
A layer can depend on other layers and can be included or excluded one
by one. It encapsulates a specific functionality and fulfills a specific
purpose. Each layer falls into a specific category:

-  Base
-  Machine (BSP)
-  Software
-  Distribution
-  Miscellaneous

*Yocto's* versioning scheme is reflected in every layer as version branches. For
each *Yocto* version, every layer has a named branch in its *Git* repository.
You can add one or many layers of each category in your build.

A collection of OpenEmbedded layers can be found here. The search function is
very helpful to see if a software package can be retrieved and integrated
easily: https://layers.openembedded.org/layerindex/branch/kirkstone/layers/

Machine
.......

Machines are configuration variables that describe the aspects of the target
hardware.

Distribution (Distro)
.....................

Distribution describes the software configuration and comes with a set of
software features.

Poky
----

*Poky* is the reference system to define *Yocto* Project compatibility. It
combines several subprojects into releases:

-  *Bitbake*
-  *Toaster*
-  OpenEmbedded Core
-  *Yocto* Documentation
-  *Yocto* Reference BSP

Bitbake
.......

*Bitbake* is the task scheduler. It is written in *Python* and interprets
recipes that contain code in *Bitbake's* own programming language, *Python*, and
bash code. The official documentation can be found here:
https://docs.yoctoproject.org/bitbake/2.0/index.html

Toaster
.......

*Toaster* is a web frontend for *Bitbake* to start and investigate builds. It
provides information about the build history and statistics on created images.
There are several use cases where the installation and maintenance of
a *Toaster* instance are beneficial. PHYTEC did not add or remove any features
to the upstream *Toaster*, provided by *Poky*. The best source for more
information is the official documentation:
https://docs.yoctoproject.org/4.0.6/toaster-manual/index.html

Official Documentation

For more general questions about *Bitbake* and *Poky* consult the mega-manual:
https://docs.yoctoproject.org/4.0.6/singleindex.html

Compatible Linux Distributions
==============================

To build *Yocto* you need a compatible *Linux* host development machine. The
list of supported distributions can be found in the reference manual:
https://docs.yoctoproject.org/4.0.6/ref-manual/system-requirements.html#supported-linux-distributions

PHYTEC BSP Introduction
=======================

BSP Structure
-------------

The BSP consists roughly of three parts. BSP management, BSP metadata, and BSP
content. The management consists of *Repo* and phyLinux while the metadata
depends on the SOC, which describes how to build the software. The content
comprises PHYTEC's *Git* repositories and external sources.

BSP Management
..............

*Yocto* is an umbrella project. Naturally, this will force the user to base
their work on several external repositories. They need to be managed in a
deterministic way. We use manifest files, which contain an XML data structure,
to describe all git repositories with pinned-down versions. The *Repo* tool and
our phyLinux wrapper script are used to manage the manifests and set up the BSP,
as described in the manifest file.

phyLinux
~~~~~~~~

phyLinux is a wrapper for *Repo* to handle downloading and setting up the BSP
with an "out of the box" experience.

Repo
~~~~

*Repo* is a wrapper around the *Repo* toolset. The phyLinux script will install
the wrapper in a global path. This is only a wrapper, though. Whenever you run
``repo init -u <url>``, you first download the *Repo* tools from *Googles* Git
server in a specific version to the ``.repo/repo`` directory. The next time you
run *Repo*, all the commands will be available. Be aware that the *Repo* version
in different build directories can differ over the years if you do not run *Repo
sync*. Also if you store information for your archives, you need to include the
complete ``.repo`` folder.

*Repo* expects a *Git* repository which will be parsed from the command line. In
the PHYTEC BSP, it is called phyÂ²octo. In this repository, all information about
a software BSP release is stored in the form of a *Repo* XML manifest. This data
structure defines URLs of *Git* servers (called "remotes") and *Git*
repositories and their states (called "projects"). The *Git* repositories can be
seen in different states. The revision field can be a branch, tag, or commit id
of a repository. This means the state of the software is not necessarily unique
and can change over time. That is the reason we use only tags or commit ids for
our releases. The state of the working directory is then unique and does not
change.

The manifests for the releases have the same name as the release itself. It is a
unique identifier for the complete BSP. The releases are sorted by the SoC
platform. The selected SoC will define the branch of the phyÂ²octo *Git*
repository which will be used for the manifest selection.

BSP Metadata
............

We include several third-party layers in our BSP to get a complete *Linux*
distribution up and running without the need to integrate external projects. All
used repositories are described in the following section.

Poky
~~~~

The PHYTEC BSP is built on top of *Poky*. It comes with a specific version,
defined in the *Repo* manifest. *Poky* comes with a specific version of
*Bitbake*. The OpenEmbedded-core layer "meta" is used as a base for our *Linux*
system.

meta-openembedded
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

OpenEmbedded is a collection of different layers containing the meta description
for many open-source software projects. We ship all OpenEmbedded layers with our
BSP, but not all of them are activated. Our example images pull several software
packages generated from OpenEmbedded recipes.

meta-qt6
~~~~~~~~

This layer provides an integration of *Qt6* in the *Poky*-based root filesystem
and is integrated into our BSP.

meta-nodejs
~~~~~~~~~~~

This is an application layer to add recent Node.js versions.

meta-gstreamer1.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is an application layer to add recent GStreamer versions.

meta-rauc
~~~~~~~~~

This layer contains the tools required to build an updated infrastructure with
`RAUC <https://rauc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_. A comparison with
other update systems can be found here: `Yocto update tools
<https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/System_Update>`_.

meta-phytec
~~~~~~~~~~~

This layer contains all machines and common features for all our BSPs. It is
PHYTEC's `Yocto Board Support Package
<https://docs.yoctoproject.org/4.0.6/bsp-guide/index.html>`_ for all supported
hardware (since *fido*) and is designed to be standalone with *Poky*. Only these
two parts are required if you want to integrate the PHYTEC's hardware into your
existing *Yocto* workflow. The features are:

-  Bootloaders in ``recipes-bsp/barebox/`` and ``recipes-bsp/u-boot/``
-  Kernels in ``recipes-kernel/linux/`` and
   ``dynamic-layers/fsl-bsp-release/recipes-kernel/linux/``
-  Many machines in ``conf/machine/``
-  Proprietary *OpenGL ES/EGL* user space libraries for AM335x and i.MX 6
   platforms
-  Proprietary *OpenCL* libraries for i.MX 6 platforms

meta-ampliphy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is our example distribution and BSP layer. It extends the basic
configuration of *Poky* with software projects described by all the other BSP
components. It provides a base for your specific development scenarios. The
current features are:

-  `systemd <https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd//>`_ init system
-  Images: ``phytec-headless-image`` for non-graphics applications
-  Camera integration with OpenCV and GStreamer examples for the i.MX 6 platform
   bundled in a ``phytec-vision-image``
-  RAUC integration: we set up basic support for an A/B system image update,
   which is possible locally and over-the-air

meta-qt6-phytec
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is our layer for Qt6 board integration and examples. The features are:

-  `Qt6 with eglfs backend <https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/embedded-linux.html>`_ for
   PHYTEC's AM335x, i.MX 6 and RK3288 platforms
-  Images: ``phytec-qt6demo-image`` for *Qt6* and video applications
-  A *Qt6* demo application demonstrating how to create a *Qt6* project using
   *QML* widgets and a *Bitbake* recipe for the *Yocto* and *systemd*
   integration. It can be found in
   ``sources/meta-qt6-phytec/recipes-qt/examples/phytec-qtdemo_git.bb``

meta-virtualization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  This layer provides support for building Xen, KVM, Libvirt, and associated
   packages necessary for constructing OE-based virtualized solutions.

meta-security
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  This layer provides security tools, hardening tools for Linux kernels, and
   libraries for implementing security mechanisms.

meta-selinux
~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  This layer's purpose is to enable SE Linux support. The majority of this
   layer's work is accomplished in *bbappend* files, used to enable SE Linux
   support in existing recipes.

meta-browser
~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  This is an application layer to add recent web browsers (Chromium, Firefox,
   etc.).

meta-rust
~~~~~~~~~

-  Includes the Rust compiler and the Cargo package manager for Rust.

   lines.

meta-freescale-3rdparty
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Provides support for boards from various vendors.

meta-freescale-distro
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  This layer provides support for Freescale's Demonstration images for use with
   OpenEmbedded and/or Yocto Freescale's BSP layer.

base (fsl-community-bsp-base)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  This layer provides BSP base files of NXP.

meta-fsl-bsp-release
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  This is the i.MX Yocto Project Release Layer.

BSP Content
...........

The BSP content gets pulled from different online sources when you first start
using *Bitbake*. All files will be downloaded and cloned in a local directory
configured as ``DL_DIR`` in *Yocto*. If you backup your BSP with the complete
content, those sources have to be backed up, too. How you can do this will be
explained in the chapter :ref:`kirkstone_gen-source-mirrors`.

Build Configuration
-------------------

The BSP initializes a build folder that will contain all files you
create by running *Bitbake* commands. It contains a ``conf`` folder
that handles build input variables.

-  ``bblayers.conf`` defines activated meta-layers,
-  ``local.conf`` defines build input variables specific to your build
-  ``site.conf`` defines build input variables specific to the development host

The two topmost build input variables are ``DISTRO`` and ``MACHINE``. They are
preconfigured ``local.conf`` when you check out the BSP using phyLinux.

We use "*Ampliphy*" as ``DISTRO`` with our BSP. This distribution will be
preselected and give you a starting point for implementing your own
configuration.

A ``MACHINE`` defines a binary image that supports specific hardware
combinations of module and baseboard. Check the ``machine.conf`` file or our
webpage for a description of the hardware.

Pre-built Images
================

For each BSP we provide pre-built target images that can be downloaded from the
PHYTEC FTP server: https://download.phytec.de/Software/Linux/

These images are also used for the BSP tests, which are flashed to the boards
during production. You can use the provided ``.wic`` images to create a bootable
SD card at any time. Identify your hardware and flash the downloaded image file
to an empty SD card using ``dd``. Please see section Images for information
about the correct usage of the command.

BSP Workspace Installation
==========================

Setting Up the Host
-------------------

You can set up the host or use one of our build-container to run a Yocto build.
You need to have a running *Linux* distribution. It should be running on a
powerful machine since a lot of compiling will need to be done.

If you want to use a build-container, you only need to install following
packages on your host

.. code-block:: console

   host:~$ sudo apt install wget git

Continue with the next step :ref:`kirkstone_git-config` after that. The documentation for
using build-container can be found in this manual after
:ref:`kirkstone_phylinux-advanced-usage` of phyLinux.

Else *Yocto* needs a handful of additional packages on your host. For *Ubuntu
20.04* you need

.. code-block:: console

   host:~$ sudo apt install gawk wget git diffstat unzip texinfo \
         gcc build-essential chrpath socat cpio python3 python3-pip \
         python3-pexpect xz-utils debianutils iputils-ping python3-git \
         python3-jinja2 libegl1-mesa libsdl1.2-dev pylint3 xterm \
         python3-subunit mesa-common-dev zstd liblz4-tool

For other distributions you can find information in the *Yocto* Quick Build:
https://docs.yoctoproject.org/4.0.6/brief-yoctoprojectqs/index.html

.. _kirkstone_git-config:

Git Configuration
-----------------

The BSP heavily utilizes *Git*. *Git* needs some information from
you as a user to identify who made changes. Create a ``~/.gitconfig`` with the
following content, if you do not have one

.. code-block:: kconfig

   [user]
       name = <Your Name>
       email = <Your Mail>
   [core]
       editor = vim
   [merge]
       tool = vimdiff
   [alias]
       co = checkout
       br = branch
       ci = commit
       st = status
       unstage = reset HEAD --
       last = log -1 HEAD
   [push]
       default = current
   [color]
       ui = auto

You should set ``name`` and ``email`` in your *Git* configuration, otherwise,
*Bitbake* will complain during the first build. You can use the two commands to
set them directly without editing ``~/.gitconfig`` manually

.. code-block:: console

   host:~$ git config --global user.email "your_email@example.com"
   host:~$ git config --global user.name "name surname"

site.conf Setup
---------------

Before starting the *Yocto* build, it is advisable to configure the development
setup. Two things are most important: the download directory and the cache
directory. PHYTEC strongly recommends configuring the setup as it will reduce
the compile time of consequent builds.

A download directory is a place where *Yocto* stores all sources fetched from
the internet. It can contain tar.gz, *Git* mirror, etc. It is very useful to set
this to a common shared location on the machine. Create this directory with 777
access rights. To share this directory with different users, all files need to
have group write access. This will most probably be in conflict with default
*umask* settings. One possible solution would be to use ACLs for this
directory

.. code-block:: console

   host:~$ sudo apt-get install acl
   host:~$ sudo setfacl -R -d -m g::rwx <dl_dir>

If you have already created a download directory and want to fix the permissions
afterward, you can do so with

.. code-block:: console

   host:~$ sudo find /home/share/ -perm /u=r ! -perm /g=r -exec chmod g+r \{\} \;
   host:~$ sudo find /home/share/ -perm /u=w ! -perm /g=w -exec chmod g+w \{\} \;
   host:~$ sudo find /home/share/ -perm /u=x ! -perm /g=x -exec chmod g+x \{\} \;

The cache directory stores all stages of the build process. *Poky* has quite an
involved caching infrastructure. It is advisable to create a shared directory,
as all builds can access this cache directory, called the shared state cache.

Create the two directories on a drive where you have approximately 50 GB of
space and assign the two variables in your ``build/conf/local.conf``

.. code-block:: kconfig

   DL_DIR ?= "<your_directory>/yocto_downloads"
   SSTATE_DIR ?= "<your_directory>/yocto_sstate"

If you want to know more about configuring your build, see the documented
example settings

.. code-block::

   sources/poky/meta-yocto/conf/local.conf.sample
   sources/poky/meta-yocto/conf/local.conf.sample.extended

phyLinux Documentation
======================

The phyLinux script is a basic management tool for PHYTEC *Yocto* BSP releases
written in *Python*. It is mainly a helper to get started with the BSP
structure. You can get all the BSP sources without the need of interacting with
*Repo* or *Git*.

The phyLinux script has only one real dependency. It requires the *wget* tool
installed on your host. It will also install the `Repo tool
<https://source.android.com/docs/setup/download>`_ in a global path
(/usr/local/bin) on your host PC. You can install it in a different location
manually. *Repo* will be automatically detected by phyLinux if it is found in
the PATH. The *Repo* tool will be used to manage the different *Git*
repositories of the *Yocto* BSP.

Get phyLinux
------------

The phyLinux script can be found on the PHYTEC download server:
https://download.phytec.de/Software/Linux/Yocto/Tools/phyLinux

Basic Usage
-----------

For the basic usage of phyLinux, type

.. code-block:: console

   host:~$ ./phyLinux --help

which will result in

.. code-block::

   usage: phyLinux [-h] [-v] [--verbose] {init,info,clean} ...

   This Programs sets up an environment to work with The Yocto Project on Phytecs
   Development Kits. Use phyLinx <command> -h to display the help text for the
   available commands.

   positional arguments:
     {init,info,clean}  commands
       init             init the phytec bsp in the current directory
       info             print info about the phytec bsp in the current directory
       clean            Clean up the current working directory

   optional arguments:
     -h, --help         show this help message and exit
     -v, --version      show program's version number and exit
     --verbose

Initialization
--------------

Create a fresh project folder

.. code-block:: console

   host:~$ mkdir ~/yocto

Calling phyLinux will use the default Python version. Starting with Ubuntu 20.04
it will be Python3. If you want to initiate a BSP, which is not compatible with
Python3, you need to set Python2 as default (temporarily) before running
phyLinux

.. code-block:: console

   host:~$ ln -s \`which python2\` python && export PATH=`pwd`:$PATH

Now run phyLinux from the new folder

.. code-block:: console

   host:~$ ./phyLinux init

A clean folder is important because phyLinux will clean its working directory.
Calling phyLinux from a directory that isn't empty will result in the following
**warning**::

   This current directory is not empty. It could lead to errors in the BSP configuration
   process if you continue from here. At the very least, you have to check your build directory
   for settings in bblayers.conf and local.conf, which will not be handled correctly in
   all cases. It is advisable to start from an empty directory of call:
   $ ./phyLinux clean
   Do you really want to continue from here?
   [yes/no]:

On the first initialization, the phyLinux script will ask you to install the
*Repo* tool in your */usr/local/bin* directory. During the execution of the
*init* command, you need to choose your processor platform (SoC), PHYTEC's BSP
release number, and the hardware you are working on

to see which SoC and Release are selected in the current workspace. If
you do not want to use the selector, phyLinux also supports command-line
arguments for several settings

.. code-block:: console

   host:~$ MACHINE=phyboard-segin-imx6ul-2 ./phyLinux init -p imx6ul -r BSP-Yocto-Ampliphy-i.MX6UL-PD22.1.1

or view the help command for more information

.. code-block:: console

After the execution of the *init* command, phyLinux will print a few important
notes as well as information for the next steps in the build process.

.. _kirkstone_phylinux-advanced-usage:

Advanced Usage
--------------

phyLinux can be used to transport software states over any medium. The state of
the software is uniquely identified by *manifest.xml*. You can create a
manifest, send it to another place and recover the software state with

.. code-block:: console

   host:~$ ./phyLinux init -x manifest.xml

You can also create a *Git* repository containing your software states. The
*Git* repository needs to have branches other than master, as we reserved the
master branch for different usage. Use phyLinux to check out the states

.. code-block:: console

   host:~$ ./phyLinux -u <url-of-your-git-repo>

Using build-container
=====================

.. warning::
   Currently, it is not possible to run the phyLinux script inside of a container.
   After a complete init with the phyLinux script on your host machine, you can use a container for the build.
   If you do not have phyLinux script running on your machine, please see phyLinux Documentation.

There are various possibilities to run a build-container. Commonly used is
docker and podman, though we prefer podman as it does not need root privileges
to run.

Installation
------------

How to install podman: https://podman.io
How to install docker: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/

Available container
-------------------

Right now we provide 4 different container based on Ubuntu LTS versions:
https://hub.docker.com/u/phybuilder

-  yocto-ubuntu-16.04
-  yocto-ubuntu-18.04
-  yocto-ubuntu-20.04
-  yocto-ubuntu-22.04

These containers can be run with podman or docker. With Yocto Project branch |yocto-codename| the container "yocto-ubuntu-20.04" is preferred.

Download/Pull container
-----------------------

.. code-block:: console

   host:~$ podman pull docker.io/phybuilder/yocto-ubuntu-20.04

   OR

   host:~$ docker pull docker.io/phybuilder/yocto-ubuntu-20.04

By adding a tag at the end separated by a colon, you can also pull or run a special tagged container.

   podman pull docker.io/phybuilder/yocto-ubuntu-20.04:phy2

You can find all available tags in our duckerhub space:

-  https://hub.docker.com/r/phybuilder/yocto-ubuntu-16.04/tags
-  https://hub.docker.com/r/phybuilder/yocto-ubuntu-18.04/tags
-  https://hub.docker.com/r/phybuilder/yocto-ubuntu-20.04/tags
-  https://hub.docker.com/r/phybuilder/yocto-ubuntu-22.04/tags

If you try to run a container, which is not pulled/downloaded, it will be pulled/downloaded automatically.

You can have a look at all downloaded/pulled container with:

.. code-block:: console

   $USERNAME@$HOSTNAME:~$ podman images
   REPOSITORY                               TAG         IMAGE ID      CREATED       SIZE

Run container
-------------

To run and use container for a Yocto build, first enter to your folder, where
you run phyLinux init before. Then start the container

.. code-block:: console

   host:~$ podman run --rm=true -v /home:/home --userns=keep-id --workdir=$PWD -it docker.io/phybuilder/yocto-ubuntu-20.04 bash

.. note::
   To run and use a container with docker, it is not that simple like with podman.
   Therefore the container-user has to be defined and configured.
   Furthermore forwarding of credentials is not given per default and has to be configured as well.

Now your commandline should look something like that (where $USERNAME is the
user, who called "podman run" and the char/number code diffs every time a
container is started)

.. code-block:: console

   $USERNAME@6593e2c7b8f6:~$

.. warning::
   If the given username is "root" you will not be able to run bitbake at all.
   Please be sure, you run the container with your own user.

Now you are ready to go on and starting the build.
To stop/close the container, just call

.. code-block:: console

   $USERNAME@6593e2c7b8f6:~$ exit

Working with Poky and Bitbake
=============================

Start the Build
---------------

After you download all the metadata with phyLinux init, you have to set up the
shell environment variables. This needs to be done every time you open a new
shell for starting builds. We use the shell script provided by *Poky* in its
default configuration. From the root of your project directory type

.. code-block:: console

   host:~$ source sources/poky/oe-init-build-env

The abbreviation for the source command is a single dot

.. code-block:: console

   host:~$ . sources/poky/oe-init-build-env

The current working directory of the shell should change to *build/*. Before
building for the first time, you should take a look at the main configuration
file

.. code-block:: console

   host:~$ vim conf/local.conf

Your local modifications for the current build are stored here. Depending on
the SoC, you might need to accept license agreements. For example, to build the
image for Freescale/NXP processors you need to accept the GPU and VPU binary
license agreements. You have to uncomment the corresponding line

.. code-block:: kconfig

   # Uncomment to accept NXP EULA # EULA can be found under
   ../sources/meta-freescale/EULA ACCEPT_FSL_EULA = "1"

Now you are ready to build your first image. We suggest starting with our
smaller non-graphical image *phytec-headless-image* to see if everything is
working correctly

.. code-block:: console

   host:~$ bitbake phytec-headless-image

The first compile process takes about 40 minutes on a modern Intel Core i7. All
subsequent builds will use the filled caches and should take about 3 minutes.

Images images
-------------

If everything worked, the images can be found under

.. code-block:: console

   host:~$ cd deploy/images/<MACHINE>

The easiest way to test your image is to configure your board for SD card boot
and to flash the build image to the SD card

.. code-block:: console

   host:~$ sudo dd if=phytec-headless-image-<MACHINE>.wic of=/dev/<your_device> bs=1M conv=fsync

Here <your_device> could be "sde", for example, depending on your system. Be
very careful when selecting the right drive! Selecting the wrong drive can
erase your hard drive! The parameter conv=fsync forces a data buffer to write
to the device before dd returns.

After booting you can log in using a serial cable or over *ssh*. There is no
root password. That is because of the debug settings in *conf/local.conf*. If
you uncomment the line

.. code-block:: kconfig

   #EXTRA_IMAGE_FEATURES = "debug-tweaks"

the debug settings, like setting an empty root password, will not be applied.

Accessing the Development States between Releases
-------------------------------------------------

Special release manifests exist to give you access to the current development
states of the *Yocto* BSP. They will not be displayed in the phyLinux selection
menu but need to be selected manually. This can be done using the following
command line

.. code-block:: console

   host:~$ ./phyLinux init -p master -r kirkstone

This will initialize a BSP that will track the latest development state. From
now on running

.. code-block:: console

   host:~$ repo sync

this folder will pull all the latest changes from our Git repositories.

Inspect your Build Configuration
--------------------------------

*Poky* includes several tools to inspect your build layout. You can inspect the
commands of the layer tool

.. code-block:: console

   host:~$ bitbake-layers

It can, for example, be used to view in which layer a specific recipe gets
modified

.. code-block:: console

   host:~$ bitbake-layers show-appends

Before running a build you can also launch *Toaster* to be able to inspect the
build details with the Toaster web GUI

.. code-block:: console

   host:~$ source toaster start

Maybe you need to install some requirements, first

.. code-block:: console

   host:~$ pip3 install -r
   ../sources/poky/bitbake/toaster-requirements.txt

You can then point your browser to *http://0.0.0.0:8000/* and continue working
with *Bitbake*. All build activity can be monitored and analyzed from this web
server. If you want to learn more about *Toaster*, look at
https://docs.yoctoproject.org/4.0.6/toaster-manual/index.html.
To shut down the *Toaster* web GUI again, execute

.. code-block:: console

   host:~$ source toaster stop

BSP Features of meta-phytec and meta-ampliphy
---------------------------------------------

*Buildinfo*
...........

The *buildinfo* task is a feature in our recipes that prints instructions to
fetch the source code from the public repositories. So you do not have to look
into the recipes yourself. To see the instructions, e.g. for the *barebox*
package, execute

.. code-block:: console

   host:~$ bitbake barebox -c buildinfo

in your shell. This will print something like

.. code-block::

   (mini) HOWTO: Use a local git repository to build barebox:

   To get source code for this package and version (barebox-2022.02.0-phy1), execute

   $ mkdir -p ~/git
   $ cd ~/git
   $ git clone git://git.phytec.de/barebox barebox
   $ cd ~/git/barebox
   $ git switch --create v2022.02.0-phy1-local-development 7fe12e65d770f7e657e683849681f339a996418b

   You now have two possible workflows for your changes:

   1. Work inside the git repository:
   Copy and paste the following snippet to your "local.conf":

   SRC_URI:pn-barebox = "git://${HOME}/git/barebox;branch=${BRANCH}"
   SRCREV:pn-barebox = "${AUTOREV}"
   BRANCH:pn-barebox = "v2022.02.0-phy1-local-development"

   After that you can recompile and deploy the package with

   $ bitbake barebox -c compile
   $ bitbake barebox -c deploy

   Note: You have to commit all your changes. Otherwise yocto doesn't pick them up!

   2. Work and compile from the local working directory
   To work and compile in an external source directory we provide the
   externalsrc.bbclass. To use it, copy and paste the following snippet to your
   "local.conf":

   INHERIT += "externalsrc"
   EXTERNALSRC:pn-barebox = "${HOME}/git/barebox"
   EXTERNALSRC_BUILD:pn-barebox = "${HOME}/git/barebox"

   Note: All the compiling is done in the EXTERNALSRC directory. Every time
   you build an Image, the package will be recompiled and build.

   NOTE: Tasks Summary: Attempted 1 tasks of which 0 didn't need to be rerun and all succeeded.
   NOTE: Writing buildhistory

As you can see, everything is explained in the output.

.. warning::

   Using *externalsrc* breaks a lot of *Yocto's* internal dependency
   mechanisms. It is not guaranteed that any changes to the source
   directory are automatically picked up by the build process and
   incorporated into the root filesystem or SD card image. You have to
   always use *--force*. E.g. to compile *barebox* and redeploy it to
   *deploy/images/<machine>* execute

   .. code-block:: console

      host:~$ bitbake barebox -c compile --force
      host:~$ bitbake barebox -c deploy

To update the SD card image with a new kernel or image first force the
compilation of it and then force a rebuild of the root filesystem. Use

.. code-block:: console

   host:~$ bitbake phytec-qt6demo-image -c rootfs --force

Note that the build system is not modifying the external source directory. If
you want to apply all patches the *Yocto* recipe is carrying to the external
source directory, run the line

.. code-block:: kconfig

   SRCTREECOVEREDTASKS="" BB_ENV_PASSTHROUGH_ADDITIONS="$BB_ENV_PASSTHROUGH_ADDITIONS SRCTREECOVEREDTASKS" bitbake <recipe> -c patch

.. _kirkstone_bsp-customization:

BSP Customization
-----------------

To get you started with the BSP, we have summarized some basic tasks from the
*Yocto* official documentation. It describes how to add additional software to
the image, change the kernel and bootloader configuration, and integrate
patches for the kernel and bootloader.

Minor modifications, such as adding software, are done in the file
*build/conf/local.conf*. There you can overwrite global configuration variables
and make small modifications to recipes.

There are 2 ways to make major changes:

1. Either create your own layer and use *bbappend* files.
2. Add everything to PHYTEC's Distro layer *meta-ampliphy*.

Creating your own layer is described in the section Create your own Layer.

Disable Qt Demo
...............

By default, the BSP image *phytec-qt6demo-image* starts a Qt6 Demo application
on the attached display or monitor. If you want to stop the demo and use the
*Linux* framebuffer console behind it, connect to the target via serial cable
or *ssh* and execute the shell command

.. code-block:: console

   target:~$ systemctl stop phytec-qtdemo.service

This command stops the demo temporarily. To start it again, reboot the
board or execute

.. code-block:: console

   target:~$ systemctl start phytec-qtdemo.service

You can disable the service permanently, so it does not start on boot

.. code-block:: console

   target:~$ systemctl disable phytec-qtdemo.service

.. tip::

   The last command only disables the service. It does not *stop* immediately.
   To see the current status execute

   .. code-block:: console

      target:~$ systemctl status phytec-qtdemo.service

If you want to disable the service by default, edit the file
*build/conf/local.conf* and add the following line

.. code-block:: kconfig

   # file build/conf/local.conf
   SYSTEMD_AUTO_ENABLE:pn-phytec-qtdemo = "disable"

After that, rebuild the image

.. code-block:: console

   host:~$ bitbake phytec-qt6demo-image

Framebuffer Console
...................

On boards with a display interface, the framebuffer console is enabled per
default. You can attach a USB keyboard and log in. To change the keyboard
layout from the English default to German, type

.. code-block:: console

   target:~$ loadkeys /usr/share/keymaps/i386/qwertz/de-latin1.map.gz

To detach the framebuffer console, run

.. code-block:: console

   target:~$ echo 0 > sys/class/vtconsole/vtcon1/bind

To completely deactivate the framebuffer console, disable the following kernel
configuration option

.. code-block::

    Device Drivers->Graphics Support->Support for framebuffer devices->Framebuffer Console Support

https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/fb/fbcon.txt

Tools Provided in the Prebuild Image
....................................

RAM Benchmark
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Performing RAM and cache performance tests can best be done by using *pmbw*
(Parallel Memory Bandwidth Benchmark/Measurement Tool). *Pmbw* runs several
assembly routines which all use different access patterns to the caches and RAM
of the SoC. Before running the test, make sure that you have about 2 MiB of
space left on the device for the log files. We also lower the level of the
benchmark to ask the kernel more aggressively for resources. The benchmark test
will take several hours.

To start the test type

.. code-block:: console

   target:~$ nice -n -2 pmbw

Upon completion of the test run, the log file can be converted to a *gnuplot*
script with

.. code-block:: console

   target:~$ stats2gnuplot stats.txt > run1.gnuplot

Now you can transfer the file to the host machine and install any version of
*gnuplot*

.. code-block:: console

   host:~$ sudo apt-get install gnuplot host:~$ gnuplot run1.gnuplot

The generated *plots-<machine>.pdf* file contains all plots. To render single
plots as *png* files for any web output you can use *Ghostscript*

.. code-block:: console

   host:~$ sudo apt-get install ghostscript
   host:~$ gs -dNOPAUSE -dBATCH -sDEVICE=png16m -r150 -sOutputFile='page-%00d.png' plots-phyboard-wega-am335x-1.pdf

Add Additional Software for the BSP Image
.........................................

To add additional software to the image, look at the OpenEmbedded layer index:
https://layers.openembedded.org/layerindex/branch/kirkstone/layers/

First, select the *Yocto* version of the BSP you have from the drop-down list in
the top left corner and click **Recipes**. Now you can search for a software
project name and find which layer it is in. In some cases, the program is in
*meta-openembedded*, *openembedded-core*, or *Poky* which means that the recipe
is already in your build tree. This section describes how to add additional
software when this is the case. If the package is in another layer, see the next
section.

You can also search the list of available recipes

.. code-block:: console

   host:~$ bitbake -s | grep <program name> # fill in program name, like in
   host:~$ bitbake -s | grep lsof

When the recipe for the program is already in the *Yocto* build, you can simply
add it by appending a configuration option to your file *build/conf/local.conf*.
The general syntax to add additional software to an image is

.. code-block:: kconfig

   # file build/conf/local.conf
   IMAGE_INSTALL:append = " <package1> <package2>"

For example, the line

.. code-block:: kconfig

   # file build/conf/local.conf
   IMAGE_INSTALL:append = " ldd strace file lsof"

installs some helper programs on the target image.

.. warning::

   The leading whitespace is essential for the append command.

All configuration options in local.conf apply to all images. Consequently, the
tools are now included in both images phytec-headless-image and
phytec-qt6demo-image.

Notes about Packages and Recipes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You are adding packages to the IMAGE_INSTALL variable. Those are not necessarily
equivalent to the recipes in your meta-layers. A recipe defines per default a
package with the same name. But a recipe can set the PACKAGES variable to
something different and is able to generate packages with arbitrary names.
Whenever you look for software, you have to search for the package name and,
strictly speaking, not for the recipe. In the worst case, you have to look at
all PACKAGES variables. A tool such as *Toaster* can be helpful in some cases.

If you can not find your software in the layers provided in the folder
*sources*, see the next section to include another layer into the *Yocto*
build.

References: `Yocto 4.0.6 Documentation - Customizing Yocto builds
<https://docs.yoctoproject.org/4.0.6/singleindex.html#user-configuration>`_

Add an Additional Layer
.......................

This is a step-by-step guide on how to add another layer to your *Yocto* build
and install additional software from it. As an example, we include the network
security scanner *nmap* in the layer *meta-security*. First, you must locate the
layer on which the software is hosted. Check out the `OpenEmbedded MetaData
Index <https://layers.openembedded.org/layerindex/branch/kirkstone/layers/>`_
and guess a little bit. The network scanner *nmap* is in the *meta-security*
layer. See `meta-security on layers.openembedded.org
<https://layers.openembedded.org/layerindex/branch/kirkstone/layer/meta-security/>`_.
To integrate it into the *Yocto* build, you have to check out the repository and
then switch to the correct stable branch. Since the BSP is based on the *Yocto*
'sumo' build, you should try to use the 'sumo' branch in the layer, too.

.. code-block:: console

   host:~$ cd sources
   host:~$ git clone git://git.yoctoproject.org/meta-security
   host:~$ cd meta-security
   host:~$ git branch -r

All available remote branches will show up. Usually there should be 'fido',
'jethro', 'krogoth', 'master', ...

.. code-block:: console

   host:~$ git checkout kirkstone

Now we add the directory of the layer to the file *build/conf/bblayers.conf* by
appending the line

.. code-block:: kconfig

   # file build/conf/bblayers.conf
   BBLAYERS += "${BSPDIR}/sources/meta-security"

to the end of the file. After that, you can check if the layer is available in
the build configuration by executing

.. code-block:: console

   host:~$ bitbake-layers show-layers

If there is an error like

.. code-block::

   ERROR: Layer 'security' depends on layer 'perl-layer', but this layer is not enabled in your configuration

the layer that you want to add (here *meta-security*), depends on another layer,
which you need to enable first. E.g. the dependency required here is a layer in
*meta-openembedded* (in the PHYTEC BSP it is in the path
*sources/meta-openembedded/meta-perl/*). To enable it, add the following line to
*build/conf/bblayers.conf*

.. code-block:: kconfig

   # file build/conf/bblayers.conf
   BBLAYERS += "${BSPDIR}/sources/meta-openembedded/meta-perl"

Now the command *bitbake-layers show-layers* should print a list of all layers
enabled including *meta-security* and *meta-perl*. After the layer is included,
you can install additional software from it as already described above. The
easiest way is to add the following line (here is the package *nmap*)

.. code-block:: kconfig

   # file build/conf/local.conf
   IMAGE_INSTALL:append = " nmap"

to your *build/conf/local.conf*. Do not forget to rebuild the image

.. code-block:: console

   host:~$ bitbake phytec-qt6demo-image

Create your own layer
..................................

Creating your layer should be one of the first tasks when customizing the BSP.
You have two basic options. You can either copy and rename our *meta-ampliphy*,
or you can create a new layer that will contain your changes. The better option
depends on your use case. *meta-ampliphy* is our example of how to create a
custom *Linux* distribution that will be updated in the future. If you want to
benefit from those changes and are, in general, satisfied with the userspace
configuration, it could be the best solution to create your own layer on top of
*Ampliphy*. If you need to rework a lot of information and only need the basic
hardware support from PHYTEC, it would be better to copy *meta-ampliphy*, rename
it, and adapt it to your needs. You can also have a look at the OpenEmbedded
layer index to find different distribution layers. If you just need to add your
own application to the image, create your own layer.

In the following chapter, we have an embedded project called "racer" which we
will implement using our *Ampliphy Linux* distribution. First, we need to create
a new layer.

*Yocto* provides a script for that. If you set up the BSP and the shell is
ready, type

.. code-block:: console

   host:~$ bitbake-layers create-layer meta-racer

Default options are fine for now. Move the layer to the source directory

.. code-block:: console

   host:~$ mv meta-racer ../sources/

Create a *Git* repository in this layer to track your changes

.. code-block:: console

   host:~$ cd ../sources/meta-racer
   host:~$ git init && git add . && git commit -s

Now you can add the layer directly to your build/conf/bblayers.conf

.. code-block:: kconfig

   BBLAYERS += "${BSPDIR}/sources/meta-racer"

or with a script provided by *Yocto*

.. code-block:: console

   host:~$ bitbake-layers add-layer meta-racer

Kernel and Bootloader Recipe and Version
........................................

First, you need to know which kernel and version are used for your target
machine. PHYTEC provides multiple kernel recipes *linux-mainline*, *linux-ti*
and *linux-imx*. The first one provides support for PHYTEC's i.MX 6 and AM335x
modules and is based on the *Linux* kernel stable releases from `kernel.org
<https://kernel.org/>`_.
The *Git* repositories URLs are:

-  *linux-mainline*: git://git.phytec.de/linux-mainline
-  *linux-ti*: git://git.phytec.de/linux-ti
-  *linux-imx:* git://git.phytec.de/linux-imx
-  *barebox*: git://git.phytec.de/barebox
-  *u-boot-imx*: git://git.phytec.de/u-boot-imx

To find your kernel provider, execute the following command

.. code-block:: console

   host:~$ bitbake virtual/kernel -e | grep "PREFERRED_PROVIDER_virtual/kernel"

The command prints the value of the variable
*PREFERRED_PROVIDER_virtual/kernel*. The variable is used in the internal
*Yocto* build process to select the kernel recipe to use. The following lines
are different outputs you might see

.. code-block:: kconfig

   PREFERRED_PROVIDER_virtual/kernel="linux-mainline"
   PREFERRED_PROVIDER_virtual/kernel="linux-ti"
   PREFERRED_PROVIDER_virtual/kernel="linux-imx"

To see which version is used, execute *bitbake -s*. For example

.. code-block:: console

   host:~$ bitbake -s | egrep -e "linux-mainline|linux-ti|linux-imx|barebox|u-boot-imx"

The parameter *-s* prints the version of all recipes. The output contains the
recipe name on the left and the version on the right

.. code-block::

   barebox                      :2022.02.0-phy1-r7.0
   barebox-hosttools-native     :2022.02.0-phy1-r7.0
   barebox-targettools          :2022.02.0-phy1-r7.0
   linux-mainline               :5.15.102-phy1-r0.0

As you can see, the recipe *linux-mainline* has version *5.15.102-phy1*. In
the PHYTEC's *linux-mainline*  *Git* repository, you will find a corresponding
tag *v5.15.102-phy1*. The version of the *barebox* recipe is 2022.02.0-phy1.
On i.MX8M\* modules the output will contain *linux-imx* and *u-boot-imx*.

.. _yocto-man-kirkstone-kernel-and-bootloader-conf:

Kernel and Bootloader Configuration
...................................

The bootloader used by PHYTEC, *barebox*, uses the same build system as the
*Linux* kernel. Therefore, all commands in this section can be used to configure
the kernel and bootloader. To configure the kernel or bootloader, execute one of
the following commands

.. code-block:: console

   host:~$ bitbake -c menuconfig virtual/kernel  # Using the virtual provider name
   host:~$ bitbake -c menuconfig linux-ti        # Or use the recipe name directly
   host:~$ bitbake -c menuconfig linux-mainline  # Or use the recipe name directly (If you use an i.MX 6 or RK3288 Module)
   host:~$ bitbake -c menuconfig linux-imx       # Or use the recipe name directly (If you use an i.MX 8M*)
   host:~$ bitbake -c menuconfig barebox         # Or change the configuration of the bootloader
   host:~$ bitbake -c menuconfig u-boot-imx      # Or change the configuration of the bootloader (If you use an i.MX 8M*)

After that, you can recompile and redeploy the kernel or bootloader

.. code-block:: console

   host:~$ bitbake virtual/kernel -c compile  # Or 'barebox' for the bootloader
   host:~$ bitbake virtual/kernel -c deploy   # Or 'barebox' for the bootloader

Instead, you can also just rebuild the complete build output with

.. code-block:: console

   host:~$ bitbake phytec-headless-image  # To update the kernel/bootloader, modules and the images

In the last command, you can replace the image name with the name of an image of
your choice. The new images and binaries are in
*build/deploy/images/<machine>/*.

.. warning::

   The build configuration is not permanent yet. Executing *bitbake
   virtual/kernel -c clean* will remove everything.

To make your changes permanent in the build system, you have to integrate your
configuration modifications into a layer. For the configuration you have two
options:

-  Include only a configuration fragment (a minimal *diff* between the
   old and new configuration)
-  Complete default configuration (*defconfig*) after your
   modifications.

Having a set of configuration fragments makes what was changed at which stage
more transparent. You can turn on and off the changes, you can manage
configurations for different situations and it helps when porting changes to new
kernel versions. You can also group changes together to reflect specific use
cases. A fully assembled kernel configuration will be deployed in the directory
*build/deploy/images/<machine>*. If you do not have any of those requirements,
it might be simpler to just manage a separate *defconfig* file.

Add a Configuration Fragment to a Recipe
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following steps can be used for both kernel and bootloader. Just replace the
recipe name *linux-mainline* in the commands with *linux-ti*, or *barebox* for
the bootloader. If you did not already take care of this, start with a clean
build. Otherwise, the diff of the configuration may be wrong

.. code-block:: console

   host:~$ bitbake linux-mainline -c clean
   host:~$ bitbake linux-mainline -c menuconfig

Make your configuration changes in the menu and generate a config
fragment

.. code-block:: console

   host:~$ bitbake linux-mainline -c diffconfig

which prints the path of the written file

.. code-block::

   Config fragment has been dumped into:
   /home/<path>/build/tmp/work/phyboard_mira_imx6_11-phytec-linux-gnueabi/linux-mainline/4.19.100-phy1-r0.0/fragment.cfg

All config changes are in the file *fragment.cfg* which should consist of only
some lines. The following example shows how to create a *bbappend* file and how
to add the necessary lines for the config fragment. You just have to adjust the
directories and names for the specific recipe: *linux-mainline*, *linux-ti*,
linux-imx, u-boot-imx, or *barebox*.

.. code-block::

   sources/<layer>/recipes-kernel/linux/linux-mainline_%.bbappend     # For the recipe linux-mainline
   sources/<layer>/recipes-kernel/linux/linux-ti_%.bbappend           # For the recipe linux-ti
   sources/<layer>/recipes-kernel/linux/linux-imx_%.bbappend          # For the recipe linux-imx
   sources/<layer>/recipes-bsp/barebox/barebox_%.bbappend             # For the recipe barebox
   sources/<layer>/recipes-bsp/u-boot/u-boot-imx_%.bbappend           # For the recipe u-boot-imx

Replace the string *layer* with your own layer created as shown above (e.g.
*meta-racer*), or just use *meta-ampliphy*. To use *meta-ampliphy*, first,
create the directory for the config fragment and give it a new name (here
*enable-r8169.cfg*) and move the fragment to the layer.

.. code-block:: console

   host:~$ mkdir -p sources/meta-ampliphy/recipes-kernel/linux/features
   # copy the path from the output of *diffconfig*
   host:~$ cp /home/<path>/build/tmp/work/phyboard_mira_imx6_11-phytec-linux-gnueabi/linux-mainline/4.19.100-phy1-r0.0/fragment.cfg \
       sources/meta-ampliphy/recipes-kernel/linux/features/enable-r8169.cfg

Then open the *bbappend* file (in this case
*sources/meta-ampliphy/recipes-kernel/linux/linux-mainline_%.bbappend* ) with
your favorite editor and add the following lines

.. code-block:: kconfig

   # contents of the file linux-mainline_%.bbappend
   FILESEXTRAPATHS:prepend := "${THISDIR}/features:"
   SRC_URI:append = " \
       file://enable-r8169.cfg \
   "

.. warning::

   Do not forget to use the correct *bbappend* filenames: *linux-ti_%.bbappend*
   for the linux-ti recipe and *barebox_%.bbappend* for the bootloader in the
   folder *recipes-bsp/barebox/* !

After saving the *bbappend* file, you have to rebuild the image. *Yocto* should
pick up the recipe changes automatically and generate a new image

.. code-block:: console

   host:~$ bitbake phytec-headless-image # Or another image name

Add a Complete Default Configuration (*defconfig*) to a Recipe
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This approach is similar to the one above, but instead of adding a fragment, a
*defconfig* is used. First, create the necessary folders in the layer you want
to use, either your own layer or *meta-ampliphy*

.. code-block:: console

   host:~$ mkdir -p sources/meta-ampliphy/recipes-kernel/linux/features/ # For both linux-mainline and linux-ti
   host:~$ mkdir -p sources/meta-ampliphy/recipes-bsp/barebox/features/ # Or for the bootloader

Then you have to create a suitable *defconfig* file. Make your configuration
changes using *menuconfig* and then save the *defconfig* file to the layer

.. code-block:: console

   host:~$ bitbake linux-mainline -c menuconfig # Or use recipe name linux-ti or barebox
   host:~$ bitbake linux-mainline -c savedefconfig # Create file 'defconfig.temp' in the work directory

This will print the path to the generated file

.. code-block::

   Saving defconfig to ..../defconfig.temp

Then, as above, copy the generated file to your layer, rename it to *defconfig*,
and add the following lines to the *bbappend* file (here
*sources/meta-ampliphy/recipes-kernel/linux/linux-mainline_%.bbappend*)

.. code-block:: kconfig

   # contents of the file linux-mainline_%.bbappend
   FILESEXTRAPATHS:prepend := "${THISDIR}/features:"
   SRC_URI:append = " \
       file://defconfig \
   "

.. tip::

   Do not forget to use the correct bbappend filenames: *linux-ti_%.bbappend*
   for the linux-ti recipe and *barebox_%.bbappend* for the bootloader in the
   folder *recipes-bsp/barebox/* !

After that, rebuild your image as the changes are picked up automatically

.. code-block:: console

   host:~$ bitbake phytec-headless-image # Or another image name

Patch the Kernel or Bootloader with *devtool*
.............................................

*Apart from using the standard versions of kernel and bootloader which are
provided in the recipes, you can modify the source code or use our own
repositories to build your customized kernel.*

+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+
| PRO                              | CON                              |

+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+

*Devtool* is a set of helper scripts to enhance the user workflow of *Yocto*. It
was integrated with version 1.8. It is available as soon as you set up your
shell environment. *Devtool* can be used to:

-  modify existing sources
-  integrate software projects into your build setup
-  build software and deploy software modifications to your target

Here we will use *devtool* to patch the kernel. We use *linux-mainline* as an
example for the AM335x Kernel. The first command we use is *devtool modify - x
<recipe> <directory>*

.. code-block:: console

   host:~$ devtool modify -x linux-mainline linux-mainline

*Devtool* will create a layer in *build/workspace* where you can see all
modifications done by *devtool* . It will extract the sources corresponding to
the recipe to the specified directory. A *bbappend* will be created in the
workspace directing the SRC_URI to this directory. Building an image with
*Bitbake* will now use the sources in this directory. Now you can modify lines
in the kernel

.. code-block:: console

   host:~$ vim linux-mainline/arch/arm/boot/dts/am335x-phycore-som.dtsi
         -> make a change
   host:~$ bitbake phytec-qt6demo-image

Your changes will now be recompiled and added to the image. If you want to store
your changes permanently, it is advisable to create a patch from the changes,
then store and backup only the patch. You can go into the *linux-mainline*
directory and create a patch using *Git*. How to create a patch is described in
:ref:`kirkstone_temporary-method` and is the same for all methods.

If you want to learn more about *devtool*, visit:

`Yocto 4.0.6 - Devtool

+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+

It is possible to alter the source code before *Bitbake* configures and compiles
the recipe. Use *Bitbake'* s *devshell* command to jump into the source
directory of the recipe. Here is the *barebox* recipe

.. code-block:: console

   host:~$ bitbake barebox -c devshell # or linux-mainline, linux-ti, linux-imx, u-boot-imx

After executing the command, a shell window opens. The current working directory
of the shell will be changed to the source directory of the recipe inside the
*tmp* folder. Here you can use your favorite editor, e.g. *vim*, *emacs*, or any
other graphical editor, to alter the source code. When you are finished, exit
the *devshell* by typing *exit* or hitting **CTRL-D**.

After leaving the *devshell* you can recompile the package

.. code-block:: console

   host:~$ bitbake barebox -c compile --force # or linux-mainline, linux-ti, linux-imx, u-boot-imx

The extra argument '--force' is important because *Yocto* does not recognize
that the source code was changed.

.. tip::

   You cannot execute the *bitbake* command in the *devshell* . You have
   to leave it first.

If the build fails, execute the devshell command again and fix it. If the build
is successful, you can deploy the package and create a new SD card image

.. code-block:: console

   host:~$ bitbake barebox -c deploy # new barebox in e.g. deploy/images/phyflex-imx6-2/barebox.bin
   host:~$ bitbake phytec-headless-image # new WIC image in e.g. deploy/images/phyflex-imx6-2/phytec-headless-image-phyflex-imx6-2.wic

.. warning::

   If you execute a clean e.g *bitbake barebox -c clean* , or if *Yocto* fetches
   the source code again, all your changes are lost!!!

   To avoid this, you can create a patch and add it to a *bbappend* file. It is
   the same workflow as described in the section about changing the
   configuration.

   You have to create the patch in the *devshell* if you use the temporary
   method and in the subdirectory created by *devtool* if you used *devtool*.

.. code-block:: console

   host:~$ bitbake barebox -c devshell            # Or linux-mainline, linux-ti
   host(devshell):~$ git status                   # Show changes files
   host(devshell):~$ git add <file>               # Add a special file to the staging area
   host(devshell):~$ git commit -m "important modification"   # Creates a commit with a not so useful commit message
   host(devshell):~$ git format-patch -1 -o ~/    # Creates a patch of the last commit and saves it in your home folder
   /home/<user>/0001-important-modification.patch  # Git prints the path of the written patch file
   host(devshell):~$ exit

After you have created the patch, you must create a *bbappend* file for it. The
locations for the three different recipes - *linux-mainline* , *linux-ti* , and
*barebox* - are

.. code-block::

   sources/<layer>/recipes-kernel/linux/linux-mainline_%.bbappend     # For the recipe linux-mainline
   sources/<layer>/recipes-kernel/linux/linux-ti_%.bbappend           # For the recipe linux-ti
   sources/<layer>/recipes-kernel/linux/linux-imx_%.bbappend        # For the recipe linux-imx
   sources/<layer>/recipes-bsp/barebox/barebox_%.bbappend             # For the recipe barebox
   sources/<layer>/recipes-bsp/u-boot/u-boot-imx_%.bbappend           # For the recipe u-boot-imx

The following example is for the recipe *barebox*. You have to adjust the paths.
First, create the folders and move the patch into them. Then create the
*bbappend* file

.. code-block:: console

   host:~$ mkdir -p sources/meta-ampliphy/recipes-bsp/barebox/features   # Or use your own layer instead of *meta-ampliphy*
   host:~$ cp ~/0001-important-modification.patch sources/meta-ampliphy/recipes-bsp/barebox/features  # copy patch
   host:~$ touch sources/meta-ampliphy/recipes-bsp/barebox/barebox_%.bbappend

.. tip::

   Pay attention to your current work directory. You have to execute the
   commands in the BSP top-level directory. Not in the *build* directory!

After that use your favorite editor to add the following snipped into the
*bbappend* file (here
*sources/meta-ampliphy/recipes-bsp/barebox/barebox_%.bbappend*)

.. code-block:: kconfig

   # contents of the file barebox_%.bbappend
   FILESEXTRAPATHS:prepend := "${THISDIR}/features:"
   SRC_URI:append = " \
       file://0001-important-modification.patch \
   "

Save the file and rebuild the *barebox* recipe with

.. code-block:: console

   host:~$ bitbake barebox -c clean # Or linux-ti, linux-mainline, linux-imx, u-boot-imx
   host:~$ bitbake barebox

If the build is successful, you can rebuild the final image with

.. code-block:: console

   host:~$ bitbake phytec-headless-image # Or another image name

The *Yocto* Project has some documentation for software developers. Check the
'Kernel Development Manual' for more information about how to configure the
kernel. Please note that not all of the information from the *Yocto* manual can
be applied to the PHYTEC BSP as we use the classic kernel approach of *Yocto*
and most of the documentation assumes the *Yocto* kernel approach.

Working with the Kernel and Bootloader using SRC_URI in *local.conf*
....................................................................

*Here we present a third option to make kernel and bootloader changes. You have
external checkouts of the linux-mainline, linux-ti, or barebox  Git
repositories. You will overwrite the URL of the source code fetcher, the
variable SRC_URI, to point to your local checkout instead of the remote
repositories.*

|                                  | (avoidable with *ccache*)        |
+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+

First, you need a local clone of the *Git* repository *barebox* or
kernel. If you do not have one, use the commands

.. code-block:: console

   host:~$ mkdir ~/git
   host:~$ cd ~/git
   host:~$ git clone git://git.phytec.de/barebox
   host:~$ cd barebox
   host:~$ git switch --create v2022.02.0-phy remotes/origin/v2022.02.0-phy

Add the following snippet to the file build/conf/local.conf

.. code-block:: kconfig

   # Use your own path to the git repository
   # NOTE: Branch name in variable "BRANCH_pn-barebox" should be the same as the
   # branch which is used in the repository folder. Otherwise your commits won't be recognized later.
   BRANCH:pn-barebox = "v2022.02.0-phy"
   SRC_URI:pn-barebox = "git:///${HOME}/git/barebox;branch=${BRANCH}"
   SRCREV:pn-barebox = "${AUTOREV}"

You also have to set the correct BRANCH name in the file. Either you create your
own branch in the *Git* repository, or you use the default (here
"v2015.02.0-phy"). Now you should recompile *barebox* from your own source

.. code-block:: console

   host:~$ bitbake barebox -c clean
   host:~$ bitbake barebox -c compile

The build should be successful because the source was not changed yet.

You can alter the source in *~/git/barebox* or the default *defconfig* (e.g.
*~/git/barebox/arch/arm/configs/imx_v7_defconfig*). After you are satisfied with
your changes, you have to make a dummy commit for *Yocto*. If you do not,
*Yocto* will not notice that the source code was modified in your repository
folder (e.g. ~/git/barebox/)

.. code-block:: console

   host:~$ git status  # show modified files
   host:~$ git diff    # show changed lines
   host:~$ git commit -a -m "dummy commit for yocto"   # This command is important!

Try to compile your new changes. *Yocto* will automatically notice that the
source code was changed and fetches and configures everything from scratch.

.. code-block:: console

   host:~$ bitbake barebox -c compile

If the build fails, go back to the source directory, fix the problem, and
recommit your changes. If the build was successful, you can deploy *barebox* and
even create a new SD card image.

.. code-block:: console

   host:~$ bitbake barebox -c deploy # new barebox in e.g. deploy/images/phyflex-imx6-2/barebox-phyflex-imx6-2.bin
   host:~$ bitbake phytec-headless-image # new sd-card image in e.g. deploy/images/phyflex-imx6-2/phytec-headless-image-phyflex-imx6-2.wic

If you want to make additional changes, just make another commit in the
repository and rebuild *barebox* again.

Add Existing Software with "Sustainable Method"
...............................................

Now that you have created your own layer, you have a second option to add
existing software to existing image definitions. Our standard image is defined
in meta-ampliphy

.. code-block::

   meta-ampliphy/recipes-images/images/phytec-headless-image.bb

In your layer, you can now modify the recipe with a *bbappend* without modifying
any BSP code

.. code-block::

   meta-racer/recipes-images/images/phytec-headless-image.bbappend

The append will be parsed together with the base recipe. As a result, you can
easily overwrite all variables set in the base recipe, which is not always what
you want. If we want to include additional software, we need to append it to the
IMAGE_INSTALL variable

.. code-block:: kconfig

   IMAGE_INSTALL:append = " rsync"

Add Linux Firmware Files to the Root Filesystem
...............................................

It is a common task to add an extra firmware file to your root filesystem into
*/lib/firmware/*. For example, WiFi adapters or PCIe Ethernet cards might need
proprietary firmware. As a solution, we use a *bbappend* in our layer. To create
the necessary folders, *bbappend* and copy the firmware file type

.. code-block:: console

   host:~$ cd meta-racer   # go into your layer
   host:~$ mkdir -p recipes-kernel/linux-firmware/linux-firmware/
   host:~$ touch recipes-kernel/linux-firmware/linux-firmware_%.bbappend
   host:~$ cp ~/example-firmware.bin recipes-kernel/linux-firmware/linux-firmware/    # adapt filename

Then add the following content to the *bbappend* file and replace every
occurrence of *example-firmware.bin* with your firmware file name.

.. code-block:: kconfig

   # file recipes-kernel/linux-firmware/linux-firmware_%.bbappend

   FILESEXTRAPATHS:prepend := "${THISDIR}/linux-firmware:"
   SRC_URI += "file://example-firmware.bin"

   do_install:append () {
           install -m 0644 ${WORKDIR}/example-firmware.bin ${D}/lib/firmware/example-firmware.bin
   }

   # NOTE: Use "=+" instead of "+=". Otherwise file is placed into the linux-firmware package.
   PACKAGES =+ "${PN}-example"
   FILES:${PN}-example = "/lib/firmware/example-firmware.bin"

Now try to build the linux-firmware recipe

.. code-block:: console

   host:~$ . sources/poky/oe-init-build-env
   host:~$ bitbake linux-firmware

This should generate a new package *deploy/ipk/all/linux-firmware-example*.

As the final step, you have to install the firmware package to your image. You
can do that in your *local.conf* or image recipe via

.. code-block:: kconfig

   # file local.conf or image recipe
   IMAGE_INSTALL += "linux-firmware-example"

.. warning::

   Ensure that you have adapted the package name *linux-firmware-example* with
   the name you assigned in *linux-firmware_%.bbappend*.

Change the *u-boot* Environment via *bbappend* Files
....................................................

All i.MX8M\* products use the u-boot bootloader. The u-boot environment can be
modified using the Temporary Method. In the *u-boot-imx* sources modify the
header file corresponding to the processor located in
*include/configs/phycore_imx8m\**. New environment variables should be added at
the end of *CONFIG_EXTRA_ENV_SETTINGS*

.. code-block:: kconfig

   #define CONFIG_EXTRA_ENV_SETTINGS \
   [...]
   PHYCORE_FITIMAGE_ENV_BOOTLOGIC \
   "newvariable=1\0"

Commit the changes and and create the file *u-boot-imx_%.bbappend* in your layer
at *<layer>/recipes-bsp/u-boot/u-boot-imx_%.bbappend*

.. code-block:: kconfig

   # contents of the file u-boot-imx_%.bbappend
   FILESEXTRAPATHS:prepend := "${THISDIR}/features:"
   SRC_URI:append = " \
       file://0001-environment-addition.patch \
   "

Change the *barebox* Environment via *bbappend* Files
.....................................................

Since *BSP-Yocto-AM335x-16.2.0* and *BSP-Yocto-i.MX6-PD16.1.0*, the *barebox*
environment handling in *meta-phytec* has changed. Now it is possible to add,
change, and remove files in the *barebox* environment via the *Python* bitbake
task *do_env*. There are two *Python* functions to change the environment. Their
signatures are:

-  *env_add(d, *\ **filename as string**\ *, *\ **file content as string**\ *)*:
   to add a new file or overwrite an existing file
-  *env_rm(d, *\ **filename as string**\ *)*: to remove a file

The first example of a *bbappend* file in the custom layer *meta-racer* shows
how to add a new non-volatile variable *linux.bootargs.fb* in the *barebox*
environment folder */env/nv/*

.. code-block:: kconfig

   # file meta-racer/recipes-bsp/barebox/barebox_2022.02.0-phy1.bbappend
   python do_env:append() {
       env_add(d, "nv/linux.bootargs.fb", "imxdrm.legacyfb_depth=32\n")
   }

The next example shows how to replace the network configuration file
*/env/network/eth0*

.. code-block:: kconfig

   # file meta-racer/recipes-bsp/barebox/barebox_2022.02.0-phy1.bbappend
   python do_env:append() {
       env_add(d, "network/eth0",
   """#!/bin/sh

   # ip setting (static/dhcp)
   ip=static
   global.dhcp.vendor_id=barebox-${global.hostname}

   # static setup used if ip=static
   ipaddr=192.168.178.5
   netmask=255.255.255.0
   gateway=192.168.178.1
   serverip=192.168.178.1
   """)
   }

In the above example, the *Python* multiline string syntax **""" text """** is
used to avoid adding multiple newline characters *\\n* into the recipe *Python*
code. The *Python* function *env_add* can add and overwrite environment files.

The next example shows how to remove an already added environment file, for
example *,* */env/boot/mmc*

.. code-block:: kconfig

   # file meta-racer/recipes-bsp/barebox/barebox_2022.02.0-phy1.bbappend
   python do_env:append() {
       env_rm(d, "boot/mmc")
   }

Debugging the Environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to see all environment files that are added in the build process,
you can enable a debug flag in the *local.conf*

.. code-block:: kconfig

   # file local.conf
   ENV_VERBOSE = "1"

After that, you have to rebuild the *barebox* recipe to see the debugging
output

.. code-block:: console

   host:~$ bitbake barebox -c clean
   host:~$ bitbake barebox -c configure

The output of the last command looks like this

.. code-block::

   [...]
   WARNING: barebox-2022.02.0-phy1-r7.0 do_env_write: File 'nv/allow_color' content "false"
   WARNING: barebox-2022.02.0-phy1-r7.0 do_env_write: File 'nv/linux.bootargs.base' content "consoleblank=0"
   WARNING: barebox-2022.02.0-phy1-r7.0 do_env_write: File 'nv/linux.bootargs.fb' content "imxdrm.legacyfb_depth=32"
   WARNING: barebox-2022.02.0-phy1-r7.0 do_env_write: File 'nv/linux.bootargs.rootfs' content "rootwait ro fsck.repair=yes"

Changing the Environment (depending on Machines)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you need to apply some *barebox* environment modifications only to a single
or only a few machines, you can use *Bitbake'* s machine overwrite syntax. For
the machine overwrite syntax, you append a machine name or SoC name (such as
*mx6* , *ti33x,* or *rk3288* ) with an underscore to a variable or task

.. code-block:: kconfig

   DEPENDS:remove:mx6 = "virtual/libgl" or
   python do_env_append_phyboard-mira-imx6-4().

The next example adds the environment variables only if the MACHINE is set to
*phyboard-mira-imx6-4*

.. code-block:: kconfig

   # file meta-phytec/recipes-bsp/barebox/barebox_2022.02.0-phy1.bbappend
   python do_env:append:phyboard-mira-imx6-4() {
       env_add(d, "nv/linux.bootargs.cma", "cma=64M\n")
   }

*Bitbake's* override syntax for variables is explained in more detail at:
https://docs.yoctoproject.org/bitbake/2.0/bitbake-user-manual/bitbake-user-manual-metadata.html#conditional-metadata

Upgrading the *barebox* Environment from Previous BSP Releases
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Prior to BSP version *BSP-Yocto-AM335x-16.2.0* and *BSP-Yocto-i.MX6-PD16.1.0* ,
*barebox* environment changes via *bbappend* file were done differently. For
example, the directory structure in your meta layer (here *meta-skeleton* ) may
have looked like this

.. code-block:: console

   $ tree -a sources/meta-skeleton/recipes-bsp/barebox/
   sources/meta-skeleton/recipes-bsp/barebox
   â”œâ”€â”€ barebox
   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ phyboard-wega-am335x-3
   â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ boardenv
   â”‚       â”‚   â””â”€â”€ .gitignore
   â”‚       â””â”€â”€ machineenv
   â”‚           â””â”€â”€ nv
   â”‚               â””â”€â”€ linux.bootargs.cma
   â””â”€â”€ barebox_%.bbappend

and the file *barebox_%.bbappend* contained

.. code-block:: kconfig

   # file sources/meta-skeleton/recipes-bsp/barebox/barebox_%.bbappend
   FILESEXTRAPATHS:prepend := "${THISDIR}/barebox:"

In this example, all environment changes from the directory *boardenv* in the
layer *meta-phytec* are ignored and the file *nv/linux.bootargs.cma* is added.
For the new handling of the *barebox* environment, you use the *Python*
functions *env_add* and *env_rm* in the *Python* task *do_env*. Now the above
example translates to a single *Python* function in the file
*barebox_%.bbappend* that looks like

.. code-block:: kconfig

   # file sources/meta-skeleton/recipes-bsp/barebox/barebox_%.bbappend
   FILESEXTRAPATHS:prepend := "${THISDIR}/barebox:"
   python do_env:append() {
       # Removing files (previously boardenv)
       env_rm(d, "config-expansions")
       # Adding new files (previously machineenv)
       env_add(d, "nv/linux.bootargs.cma", "cma=64M\n")
   }

.. _kirkstone_changing-net-config:

Changing the Network Configuration
..................................

To tweak IP addresses, routes, and gateways at runtime you can use the tools
*ifconfig* and *ip* . Some examples

.. code-block:: console

   target:~$ ip addr                                         # Show all network interfaces
   target:~$ ip route                                        # Show all routes
   target:~$ ip addr add 192.168.178.11/24 dev eth0          # Add static ip and route to interface eth0
   target:~$ ip route add default via 192.168.178.1 dev eth0 # Add default gateway 192.168.178.1
   target:~$ ip addr del 192.168.178.11/24 dev eth0          # Remove static ip address from interface eth0

The network configuration is managed by *systemd-networkd* . To query the
current status use

.. code-block:: console

   target:~$ networkctl status
   target:~$ networkctl list

The network daemon reads its configuration from the directories
*/etc/systemd/network/* , */run/systemd/network/* , and */lib/systemd/network/*
(from higher to lower priority). A sample configuration in
*/lib/systemd/network/10-eth0.network* looks like this

.. code-block:: kconfig

   # file /lib/systemd/network/10-eth0.network
   [Match]
   Name=eth0

   [Network]
   Address=192.168.3.11/24
   Gateway=192.168.3.10

These files *\*.network* replace */etc/network/interfaces* from other
distributions. You can either edit the file *10-eth0.network* in-place or copy
it to */etc/systemd/network/* and make your changes there. After changing a file
you must restart the daemon to apply your changes

.. code-block:: console

   target:~$ systemctl restart systemd-networkd

To see the syslog message of the network daemon, use

.. code-block:: console

   target:~$ journalctl --unit=systemd-networkd.service

To modify the network configuration at build time, look at the recipe
*sources/meta-ampliphy/recipes-core/systemd/systemd-machine-units.bb*
and the interface files in the folder
*meta-ampliphy/recipes-core/systemd/systemd-machine-units/* where the static IP
address configuration for *eth0* (and optionally *eth1*) is done.

For more information, see https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Systemd-networkd
and https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/systemd.network.html.

Changing the Wireless Network Configuration
...........................................

Connecting to a WLAN Network
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  First set the correct regulatory domain for your country

.. code-block:: console

   target:~$ iw reg set DE
   target:~$ iw reg get

You will see

.. code-block::

   country DE: DFS-ETSI
      (2400 - 2483 @ 40), (N/A, 20), (N/A)
      (5150 - 5250 @ 80), (N/A, 20), (N/A), NO-OUTDOOR
      (5250 - 5350 @ 80), (N/A, 20), (0 ms), NO-OUTDOOR, DFS
      (5470 - 5725 @ 160), (N/A, 26), (0 ms), DFS
      (57000 - 66000 @ 2160), (N/A, 40), (N/A)

-  Set up the wireless interface

.. code-block:: console

   target:~$ ip link    # list all interfaces. Search for wlan*
   target:~$ ip link set up dev wlan0

-  Now you can scan for available networks

.. code-block:: console

   target:~$ iw wlan0 scan | grep SSID

You can use a cross-platform supplicant with support for *WEP*, *WPA*, and
*WPA2* called *wpa_supplicant* for an encrypted connection.

-  To do so, add the network credentials to the file
   */etc/wpa_supplicant.conf*

.. code-block:: kconfig

   Confluence country=DE network={ ssid="<SSID>" proto=WPA2 psk="<KEY>" }

-  Now a connection can be established

.. code-block:: console

   target:~$ wpa_supplicant -Dnl80211 -c/etc/wpa_supplicant.conf -iwlan0 -B

This should result in the following output

.. code-block::

   ENT-CONNECTED - Connection to 88:33:14:5d:db:b1 completed [id=0 id_str=]

To finish the configuration you can configure DHCP to receive an IP address
(supported by most WLAN access points). For other possible IP configurations,
see the section :ref:`kirkstone_changing-net-config`.

-  First, create the directory

.. code-block:: console

   target:~$ mkdir -p /etc/systemd/network/

-  Then add the following configuration snippet in
   */etc/systemd/network/10-wlan0.network*

.. code-block:: kconfig

   # file /etc/systemd/network/10-wlan0.network
   [Match]
   Name=wlan0

   [Network]
   DHCP=yes

-  Now, restart the network daemon so that the configuration takes effect

.. code-block:: console

   target:~$ systemctl restart systemd-networkd

Creating a WLAN Access Point
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section provides a basic access point (AP) configuration for a
secured *WPA2* network.

Find the name of the WLAN interface with

.. code-block:: console

   target:~$ ip link

Edit the configuration in */etc/hostapd.conf*. It is strongly dependent on
the use case. The following shows an example

.. code-block:: kconfig

   # file /etc/hostapd.conf
   interface=wlan0
   driver=nl80211
   ieee80211d=1
   country_code=DE
   hw_mode=g
   ieee80211n=1
   ssid=Test-Wifi
   channel=2
   wpa=2
   wpa_passphrase=12345678
   wpa_key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
   wpa_pairwise=CCMP

Set up and start the DHCP server for the network interface *wlan0* via
*systemd-networkd*

.. code-block:: console

   target:~$ mkdir -p /etc/systemd/network/
   target:~$ vi /etc/systemd/network/10-wlan0.network

Insert the following text into the file

.. code-block:: kconfig

   [Match]
   Name=wlan0

   [Network]
   Address=192.168.0.1/24
   DHCPServer=yes

   [DHCPServer]
   EmitDNS=yes
   target:~$ systemctl restart systemd-networkd
   target:~$ systemctl status  systemd-networkd -l   # check status and see errors

Start the userspace daemon *hostapd*

.. code-block:: console

   target:~$ systemctl start hostapd
   target:~$ systemctl status hostapd -l # check for errors

Now, you should see the WLAN network *Test-Wifi* on your terminal device
(laptop, smartphone, etc.).

If there are problems with the access point, you can either check the log
messages with

.. code-block:: console

   target:~$ journalctl --unit=hostapd

or start the daemon in debugging mode from the command line

.. code-block:: console

   target:~$ systemctl stop hostapd
   target:~$ hostapd -d /etc/hostapd.conf -P /var/run/hostapd.pid

You should see

.. code-block::

   ...
   wlan0: interface state UNINITIALIZED->ENABLED
   wlan0: AP-ENABLED

Further information about AP settings and the userspace daemon
*hostapd* can be found at

.. code-block::

Then rebuild your image

.. code-block:: console

   host:~$ bitbake phytec-qt6demo-image

.. tip::

   Most examples do not work out of the box, because they depend on the *GTK*
   graphics library. The BSP only supports *Qt6* .

Add Minimal PHP web runtime with *lightpd*
..........................................

This is one example of how to add a small runtime for PHP applications and a web
server on your target. Lighttpd can be used together with the PHP command line
tool over cgi. This solution weights only 5.5 MiB of disk storage. It is already
preconfigured in meta-ampliphy. Just modify the build configuration to install
it on the image

.. code-block:: kconfig

   # file conf/local.conf
   # install lighttpd with php cgi module
   IMAGE_INSTALL:append = " lighttpd"

After booting the image, you should find the example web content in */www/pages*
. For testing php, you can delete the *index.html* and replace it with a
*index.php* file

.. code-block:: html

   <html>
     <head>
       <title>PHP-Test</title>
     </head>
     <body>
       <?php phpinfo(); ?>
     </body>
   </html>

On your host, you can point your browser to the board's IP, (e.g. 192.168.3.11)
and the phpinfo should show up.

Common Tasks
------------

Debugging a User Space Application
..................................

The phytec-qt6demo-image can be cross-debugged without any change. For
cross-debugging, you just have to match the host sysroot with the image in use.
So you need to create a toolchain for your image

.. code-block:: console

   host:~$ bitbake -c populate_sdk phytec-qt6demo-image

Additionally, if you want to have full debug and backtrace capabilities for all
programs and libraries in the image, you could add

.. code-block:: kconfig

   DEBUG_BUILD = "1"

to the ``conf/local.conf``. This is not necessary in all cases. The compiler
options will then be switched from FULL_OPTIMIZATION to DEBUG_OPTIMIZATION. Look
at the *Poky* source code for the default assignment of DEBUG_OPTIMIZATION.

To start a cross debug session, install the SDK as mentioned previously, source
the SDK environment, and run *Qt Creator* in the same shell. If you do not use
*Qt Creator*, you can directly call the arm-<..>-gdb debugger instead which
should be in your path after sourcing the environment script.

If you work with *Qt Creator*, have a look at the appropriate documentation
delivered with your product (either QuickStart or Application Guide) for
information on how to set up the toolchain.

When starting the debugger with your userspace application you will get a
SIGILL, an illegal instruction from the *libcrypto*. *Openssl* probes for the
system capabilities by trapping illegal instructions, which will trigger *GDB*.
You can ignore this and hit **Continue** (c command). You can permanently ignore
this stop by adding

.. code-block:: kconfig

   handle SIGILL nostop

to your *GDB* startup script or in the *Qt Creator GDB* configuration panel.
Secondly, you might need to disable a security feature by adding

.. code-block:: kconfig

   set auto-load safe-path /

to the same startup script, which will enable the automatic loading of libraries
from any location.

If you need to have native debugging, you might want to install the debug
symbols on the target. You can do this by adding the following line to your
*conf/local.conf*

.. code-block:: kconfig

   EXTRA_IMAGE_FEATURES += "dbg-pkgs"

For cross-debugging, this is not required as the debug symbols will be loaded
from the host side and the dbg-pkgs are included in the SDK of your image
anyway.

.. _kirkstone_gen-source-mirrors:

Generating Source Mirrors, working Offline
..........................................

Modify your *site.conf* (or *local.conf* if you do not use a *site.conf* ) as
follows

.. code-block:: kconfig

   #DL_DIR ?= "" don't set it! It will default to a directory inside /build
   SOURCE_MIRROR_URL = "file:///home/share/yocto_downloads/"
   INHERIT += "own-mirrors"
   BB_GENERATE_MIRROR_TARBALLS = "1"

Now run

.. code-block:: console

   host:~$ bitbake --runall=fetch <image>

for all images and for all machines you want to provide sources for. This will
create all the necessary *tar* archives. We can remove all SCM subfolders, as
they are duplicated with the tarballs

.. code-block:: console

   host:~$ rm -rf build/download/git2/
   etc...

Please consider that we used a local source mirror for generating the dl_dir.
Because of that, some archives will be linked locally.

First, we need to copy all files, resolving symbolic links into the new mirror
directory

.. code-block:: console

   host:~$ rsync -vaL <dl_dir> ${TOPDIR}/../src_mirror/

Now we clean the */build* directory by deleting everything except */build/conf/*
but including */build/conf/sanity*. We change *site.conf* as follows

.. code-block:: kconfig

   SOURCE_MIRROR_URL = "file://${TOPDIR}/../src_mirror"
   INHERIT += "own-mirrors"
   BB_NO_NETWORK = "1"
   SCONF_VERSION = "1"

The BSP directory can now be compressed with

.. code-block:: console

   host:~$ tar cfJ <filename>.tar.xz <folder>

where filename and folder should be the full BSP Name.

Compiling on the Target
.......................

To your *local.conf* add

.. code-block:: kconfig

   IMAGE_FEATURES:append = " tools-sdk dev-pkgs"

Different Toolchains
....................

There are several ways to create a toolchain installer in *Poky*. One option is
to run

.. code-block:: console

   host:~$ bitbake meta-toolchain

This will generate a toolchain installer in *build/deploy/sdk* which can be used
for cross-compiling of target applications. However, the installer does not
include libraries added to your image, so it is a bare *GCC* compiler only. This
is suited for bootloader and kernel development.

Another you can run is

.. code-block:: console

   host:~$ bitbake -c populate_sdk <your_image>

This will generate a toolchain installer containing all necessary development
packages of the software installed on the root filesystem of the target. This
installer can be handed over to the user space application development team and
includes all necessary parts to develop an application. If the image contains
the *QT* libraries, all of those will be available in the installer too.

The third option is to create the ADT (Application Development Toolkit)
installer. It will contain the cross-toolchain and some tools to aid the
software developers, for example, an *Eclipse* plugin and a *QEMU* target
simulator.

.. code-block:: console

   host:~$ bitbake adt-installer

The ADT is untested for our BSP at the moment.

Using the SDK
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After generating the SDK with

.. code-block:: console

   host:~$ source sources/poky/oe-init-build-env
   host:~$ bitbake -c populate_sdk phytec-qt6demo-image # or another image

run the generated binary with

.. code-block:: console

   host:~$ deploy/sdk/ampliphy-glibc-x86_64-phytec-qt6demo-image-cortexa9hf-vfp-neon-toolchain-i.MX6-PD15.3-rc.sh
   Enter target directory for SDK (default: /opt/ampliphy/i.MX6-PD15.3-rc):
   You are about to install the SDK to "/opt/ampliphy/i.MX6-PD15.3-rc". Proceed[Y/n]?
   Extracting SDK...done
   Setting it up...done
   SDK has been successfully set up and is ready to be used.

You can activate the toolchain for your shell by sourcing the file
*environment-setup* in the toolchain directory

.. code-block:: console

   host:~$ source /opt/ampliphy/i.MX6-PD15.3-rc/environment-setup-cortexa9hf-vfp-neon-phytec-linux-gnueabi

Then the necessary tools like the cross compiler and linker are in your PATH. To
compile a simple *C* program, use

.. code-block:: console

   host:~$ $CC main.c -o main

The environment variable $CC contains the path to the ARM cross compiler and
other compiler arguments needed like *-march* , *-sysroot* and *--mfloat-abi*.

.. tip::

   You cannot compile programs only with the compiler name like

   .. code-block:: console

      host:~$ arm-phytec-linux-gnueabi-gcc main.c -o main

   It will fail in many cases. Always use *CC*, CFLAGS, LDFLAGS, and so on.

For convenience, the *environment-setup* exports other environment variables
like CXX, LD, SDKTARGETSYSROOT.

A simple makefile compiling a *C* and *C++* program may look like this

.. code-block:: kconfig

   # Makefile
   TARGETS=c-program cpp-program

   all: $(TARGETS)

   c-program: c-program.c
       $(CC) $(CFLAGS) $(LDFLAGS) $< -o $@

   cpp-program: cpp-program.cpp
       $(CXX) $(CXXFLAGS) $(LDFLAGS) $< -o $@

   .PHONY: clean
   clean:
       rm -f $(TARGETS)

To compile for the target, just source the toolchain in your shell before
executing make

.. code-block:: console

   host:~$ make     # Compiling with host CC, CXX for host architecture
   host:~$ source /opt/ampliphy/i.MX6-PD15.3-rc/environment-setup-cortexa9hf-vfp-neon-phytec-linux-gnueabi
   host:~$ make     # Compiling with target CC, CXX for target architecture

If you need to specify additionally included directories in the sysroot of the
toolchain, you can use an '=' sign in the *-I* argument like

.. code-block:: kconfig

   -I=/usr/include/SDL

*GCC* replaces it by the sysroot path (here
*/opt/ampliphy/i.MX6-PD15.3-rc/sysroots/cortexa9hf-vfp-neon-phytec-linux-gnueabi/*).
See the main page of *GCC* for more information.

.. tip::

   The variables $CFLAGS and $CXXFLAGS contain the compiler debug flag '-g' by
   default. This includes debugging information in the binary and making it
   bigger. Those should be removed from the production image. If you create a
   *Bitbake* recipe, the default behavior is to turn on '-g' too. The debugging
   symbols are used in the SDK rootfs to be able to get debugging information
   when invoking *GDB* from the host. Before installing the package to the
   target rootfs, *Bitbake* will invoke *strip* on the program which removes the
   debugging symbols. By default, they are not found nor required on the target
   root filesystem

Using the SDK with GNU Autotools
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Yocto* SDK is a straightforward tool for a project that uses the *GNU
Autotools*. The traditional compile steps for the host are usually

.. code-block:: console

   host:~$ ./autogen.sh # maybe not needed
   host:~$ ./configure
   host:~$ make
   host:~$ make install DESTDIR=$PWD/build/

The commands to compile for the target machine with the *Yocto* SDK are quite
similar. The following commands assume that the SDK was unpacked to the
directory */opt/phytec-ampliphy/i.MX6-PD15.3.0/* (adapt the path as needed)

.. code-block:: console

   host:~$ source /opt/phytec-ampliphy/i.MX6-PD15.3.0/environment-setup-cortexa9hf-vfp-neon-phytec-linux-gnueabi
   host:~$ ./autogen.sh  # maybe not needed
   host:~$ ./configure ${CONFIGURE_FLAGS}
   host:~$ make
   host:~$ make install DESTDIR=$PWD/build/

Refer to the official *Yocto* documentation for more information:
https://docs.yoctoproject.org/4.0.6/singleindex.html#autotools-based-projects

Working with Kernel Modules
...........................

You will come to the point where you either need to set some options for a
kernel module or you want to blacklist a module. Those things are handled by
*udev* and go into *\*.conf* files in

.. code-block::

   /etc/modprobe.d/\*.conf.

If you want to specify an option at build time, there are three relevant
variables. If you just want to autoload a module that has no autoload
capabilities, add it to

.. code-block:: kconfig

   KERNEL_MODULE_AUTOLOAD += "your-module"

either in the kernel recipe or in the global variable scope. If you need to
specify options for a module, you can do so with

.. code-block:: kconfig

   KERNEL_MODULE_AUTOLOAD += "your-module"
   KERNEL_MODULE_PROBECONF += "your-module"
   module_conf_your-module = "options your-module parametername=parametervalue"

if you want to blacklist a module from autoloading, you can do it intuitively
with

.. code-block:: kconfig

   KERNEL_MODULE_AUTOLOAD += "your-module"
   KERNEL_MODULE_PROBECONF += "your-module"
   module_conf_your-module = "blacklist your-module"

Working with *udev*
...................

Udev (Linux dynamic device management) is a system daemon that handles dynamic
device management in /dev. It is controlled by *udev* \ rules that are located
in */etc/udev/rules.d* (sysadmin configuration space) and\  */lib/udev/rules.d/*
(vendor-provided). Here is an example of an *udev* \ rule file

.. code-block:: kconfig

   # file /etc/udev/rules.d/touchscreen.rules
   # Create a symlink to any touchscreen input device
   SUBSYSTEM=="input", KERNEL=="event[0-9]*", ATTRS{modalias}=="input:*-e0*,3,*a0,1,*18,*", SYMLINK+="input/touchscreen0"
   SUBSYSTEM=="input", KERNEL=="event[0-9]*", ATTRS{modalias}=="ads7846", SYMLINK+="input/touchscreen0"

See https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/udev.html for more details
about the syntax and usage. To get the list of attributes for a specific device
that can be used in an *udev* rule you can use the *udevadm info* tool. It
prints all existing attributes of the device node and its parents. The key-value
pairs from the output can be copied and pasted into a rule file. Some examples

.. code-block:: console

   target:~$ udevadm info -a /dev/mmcblk0
   target:~$ udevadm info -a /dev/v4l-subdev25
   target:~$ udevadm info -a -p /sys/class/net/eth0

After changing an *udev* rule, you have to notify the daemon. Otherwise, your
changes are not reflected. Use the following command

.. code-block:: console

   target:~$ udevadm control --reload-rules

While developing *udev* rules you should monitor the events in order to see when
devices are attached or unattached to the system. Use

.. code-block:: console

   target:~$ udevadm monitor

Furthermore, it is very useful to monitor the system log in another shell,
especially if the rule executes external scripts. Execute

.. code-block:: console

   target:~$ journalctl -f

.. tip::

   You cannot start daemons or heavy scripts in a *RUN* attribute. See
   https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/udev.html .

   This can only be used for very short-running foreground tasks. Running an
   event process for a long period of time may block all further events for this
   or a dependent device. Starting daemons or other long-running processes is
   not appropriate for *udev*; the forked processes, detached or not, will be
   unconditionally killed after the event handling has finished. You can use the
   special attribute *ENV{SYSTEMD_WANTS}="service-name.service"* and a
   *systemd*\ service instead.

   See
   https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/63232/what-is-the-correct-way-to-write-a-udev-rule-to-stop-a-service-under-systemd.

Troubleshooting
===============

Setscene Task Warning
---------------------

This warning occurs when the Yocto cache is in a dirty state.

.. code-block::

   WARNING: Setscene task X ([...]) failed with exit code '1' - real task

You should avoid canceling the build process or if you have to, press Ctrl-C
once and wait until the build process has stopped. To remove all these warnings
just clean the sstate cache and remove the build folders.

.. code-block:: console

   host:~$ bitbake phytec-headless-image -c cleansstate && rm -rf tmp deploy/ipk

Yocto Documentation
===================

The most important piece of documentation for a BSP user is probably the
developer manual.
https://docs.yoctoproject.org/4.0.6/dev-manual/index.html

The chapter about common tasks is a good starting point.
https://docs.yoctoproject.org/4.0.6/dev-manual/common-tasks.html#common-tasks

The complete documentation is available on one single HTML page, which is good
for searching for a feature or a variable name.
https://docs.yoctoproject.org/4.0.6/singleindex.html
