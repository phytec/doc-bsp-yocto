Yocto Documentation
===================

The most important piece of documentation for a BSP user is probably the
developer `manual`_.

The chapter about common tasks is a good starting point. `Creating Layers`_

The complete documentation is available on one single `megamanual`_ HTML page,
which is good for searching for a feature or a variable name.
